During the development of the [Fair Work Framework](https://www.fairworkconvention.scot/the-fair-work-framework/), the social care sector was identified as having significant strengths and best practice but was also recognised as being under some strain, with significant challenges to Fair Work being experienced by many frontline staff in the sector.  The Fair Work Convention noted the lack of security for social care staff; poor terms and conditions; significant difficulties in staff recruitment and retention, and commissioning / procurement practices which seem to work against both Fair Work and person-centred care. The Convention, therefore, undertook an inquiry into Fair Work in Social Care and published its report: [Fair Work in Scotland’s Social Care 2019](https://www.fairworkconvention.scot/our-report-on-fair-work-in-social-care/) on 26 February 2019. 

The Scottish Government will work with partners to consider and respond to the recommendations set out in the Fair Work Convention’s Social Care Inquiry Report to ensure that fair work is embedded in the delivery of social care services including the procurement process.
