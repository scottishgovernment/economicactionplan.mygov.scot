**Delivering Fair Work during the Coronavirus outbreak**  

On 25 March 2020, Fiona Hyslop Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work & Culture and STUC General Secretary Grahame Smith issued a joint statement outlining the shared commitment to fair work practices in Scotland.  The statement calls on employers, trades unions and workers to work together to throughout the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and ensure workers are treated fairly.  It can be accessed at: [gov.scot/news/protecting-workers-during-coronavirus-outbreak](https://www.gov.scot/news/protecting-workers-during-coronavirus-outbreak/).  

The [Fair Work Agreement](https://www.gov.scot/publications/fair-work-agreement-between-scottish-ministers-and-the-recognised-civil-service-unions/) was signed in November 2018 by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work and the recognised Civil Service Trade Unions.  It illustrates the commitment to embedding Fair Work into local employment policy and practice in the Civil Service sector.  

All public bodies in Scotland are encouraged to work with their trade union partners to adopt the terms of the agreement.  

The agreement aligns with the Fair Work Convention’s [Framework](https://www.fairworkconvention.scot/the-fair-work-framework/) and promotes work that offers:

- respect
- opportunity
- fulfilment
- security
- effective voice
