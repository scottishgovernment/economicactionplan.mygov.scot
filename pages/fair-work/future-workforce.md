The [Enterprise and Skills Board’s Strategic Plan](https://www.gov.scot/publications/working-collaboratively-better-scotland/) identified the need to sustain a culture of Fair Work and Fair Work practices in the long term, making Fair Work the norm for every worker and every employer across Scotland. As well as promoting an understanding of the [Fair Work Framework](https://www.fairworkconvention.scot/the-fair-work-framework/) dimensions in today’s labour market, we will need to educate our young people about Fair Work as they progress on their learning journey; what it means for them as individuals and for the wider society.

To do this, we will work with education and skills development colleagues and trade union partners to identify opportunities, including through [Developing the Young Workforce](https://www.dyw.scot/) and [Unions into Schools](http://www.stuc.org.uk/unions-into-schools), to increase awareness and understanding of Fair Work including gender issues.  We will also explore options for promoting Fair Work within further and higher education.

This will help ensure that the young workforce have Fair Work in their DNA and are well placed to adopt Fair Work in their roles. They will also have clear ideas about their expectations from work, the work environment, their employer and their colleagues, further encouraging Fair Work and driving continuous improvement.
