International trade and investment are vital to improving Scotland's competitiveness and reducing economic inequality. Access to a skilled workforce is essential for our businesses to reach their potential.

The actions we are taking throughout this plan are designed to create a better environment for businesses, people and our natural assets to flourish. In doing so we are enriching Scotland’s globally renowned reputation as one of the best places to invest, live and work. And, to ensure we remain outward looking and open for business, we are also taking action to help companies grow their businesses through exports and prepare for Brexit.  Through actions like our Scotland is Now campaign, we are maximising Scotland’s presence in global markets and showcasing our assets and expertise to the world.
