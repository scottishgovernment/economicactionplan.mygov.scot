* **Our new Invest in Scotland Prospectus will target key markets and sectors with positive reasons to invest in Scotland**
* **Extend the range and reach of our international network to support investment in Scotland**
* **Reduce the burden of Air Departure Tax by 50%**

<hr>

Our new Invest in Scotland Prospectus will build on Scotland’s outstanding record in attracting investment. Targeting key markets and sectors for Scotland, including digital and precision medicine, we will demonstrate the potential and advantages of locating in Scotland to international investors and companies. We will also align the global resources and expertise we have around investment with our Infrastructure Mission, to raise the profile of the high quality of capital investment opportunities available in Scotland.

And we will continue to develop the range and reach of our international network, ensuring that trade and investment is central to its purpose, including opening a new office in Paris with an enhanced Scottish Development International (SDI) presence and enhancing our presence in Canada by opening an office in Ottawa in 2018.

We will aim to reduce the burden of Air Departure Tax by 50% by the end of this Parliament, increasing Scotland’s attractiveness as an international business destination.
