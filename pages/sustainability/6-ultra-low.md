***Putting Scotland at the forefront of markets in Ultra Low Emissions Vehicles***

## Key points: 

* Launch Circular Economy Bill as part of 2019-2020 legislative programme
* Investing £17 million to expand Scotland’s electric vehicle (EV) charging network
* Investing £2 Million to expand zero carbon mobility 
* Upscale opportunities across emerging hydrogen transport markets
* Public Sector Fleet Commitment
* Research and development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) or Driverless Cars

The Circular Economy Bill will continue to advance Scotland’s ambitions for the circular economy through measures to help reduce, reuse and recycle materials and deal with items that we know cause environmental harm.  The provisions will enable charges to be applied to the provision of items such as single-use drinks cups, helping to tackle the 4,000 tonnes of waste that beverage cups create in Scotland each year.  

We want Scotland to be at the forefront of growth in ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEV) markets, to ensure our business community and workforce benefit from the opportunities that new markets and technologies present.  

In addition to investing over £15 million to expand Scotland’s electric vehicle (EV) charging network (Charge Place Scotland), we will work with our stakeholders to support new commercial opportunities while delivering benefits to consumers and integrating EVs into our electricity networks.  

We will invest £2 million to take ideas for sustainable and zero carbon mobility to fully-formed propositions for large-scale investments.  We will develop proposals for new centres of expertise for emerging technologies and business models in sustainable mobility, drawing on the existing strengths of Scotland's academic and company base.  This will include a new Hydrogen Accelerator Programme to attract technical experts to help scale up and quicken the deployment of hydrogen technologies across Scotland with an emphasis on sustainable mobility.  

We will work with industry to assess the skills the Scottish motor trade will need to support the transition to zero emission mobility. This will build on our work with the Energy Skills Partnership and other partners on the Safe Working with Electric Vehicles project.  

In collaboration with our enterprise agencies, we will invest £2 million to take ideas for sustainable and zero carbon mobility to fully-formed propositions suitable for large-scale investments and develop proposals for new centres of expertise for emerging technologies and business models in sustainable mobility.  

We have formed a new Strategic Partnership with our electricity network companies to improve the delivery and integration of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and our electricity networks in Scotland.  This will include £7.5 million for the delivery of demonstration projects with network companies to improve knowledge and demonstrate the critical role they will play in accelerating universal access to key public infrastructure at the lowest cost to consumers. In parallel we will also be intensifying our engagement with industry and key stakeholders to consider and develop new financing and delivery models for electric vehicle charging in Scotland.  

We will work with public bodies to phase out petrol and diesel cars from our public sector fleet and phase out the need for any new petrol and diesel light commercial vehicles by 2025.  The market for heavier zero emission vehicles, such as heavy goods vehicles, is less developed than for cars.  We will work with public bodies, the automotive sector and Scotland’s innovation community to create the conditions to phase out the need for all new petrol and diesel vehicles in Scotland’s public sector fleet by 2030.  We will apply an element of flexibility and pragmatism within the staged commitments for specialist front line and emergency service vehicles to ensure operational capability is maintained during the transition.  

We will continue to use our successful Switched on Fleets programme, which has already provided over £13m to public bodies, to support investment in zero or ultra-low emission vehicles.  The commitment isn't just about reducing emissions as the public sector owns or operates over 30,000 vehicles, which is a huge market and opportunity for technology innovation and Scottish supply chains.  

This year we will continue to support the uptake of low emission vehicles and development of Scotland's electric vehicle (EV) charging network (Charge Place Scotland). We will provide over £20m to support investment by local authorities, homes and business. We will also provide an additional £17m into the Low Carbon Loan scheme to support the demand for Ultra Low Emission Vehicles, expanding the scheme to include used electric vehicles.  

We will establish an Expert Advisory Group to advise on how Scotland's automotive sector can benefit from the transition to zero emission vehicles. We will develop and a new supply chain accelerator programme to help public bodies and commercial partners find innovative solutions to the challenge of decarbonising public sector vehicle fleets.  

We will launch a new Hydrogen Accelerator Programme to attract technical experts to help scale up and quicken the deployment of hydrogen technologies across Scotland, with an emphasis on sustainable mobility.  

We will also continue to encourage and support ongoing research, development, demonstration, and deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) or driverless cars. For example, we held a two-day ‘CAV Scotland’ event in 2018, with the next Cav Scotland conference taking place in Glasgow on the 13 and 14 November 2019. We have also been successful in a bid to Innovate UKs ‘CAV4’ call for funding of an autonomous bus demonstrator. We are now working with partners (Fusion Processing, Stagecoach, Bristol Robotics Laboratory, Alexander Dennis, University of West of England and Napier University) to deliver a pilot autonomous bus service between Fife and Edinburgh across the Forth Road Bridge public transport corridor by Summer 2020. We are also partnering with INRIX on their ‘AV Road Rules’ platform to digitise part of the trunk road network and provide key data on road characteristics and encourage autonomous vehicle developers to bring trials and innovative technologies to Scotland.
