We want Scotland to be at the forefront of growth in ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEV) markets, to ensure our business community and workforce benefit from the opportunities that new markets and technologies present.

In addition to investing over £15 million to expand Scotland’s electric vehicle (EV) charging network (Charge Place Scotland), we will work with our stakeholders to support new commercial opportunities while delivering benefits to consumers and integrating EVs into our electricity networks.

In collaboration with our enterprise agencies, we will invest in emerging research and commercial opportunities, with a particular emphasis on testing and demonstration facilities and innovation at the interface between energy and mobility.

In collaboration with the energy network operators, we will support opportunities for data-driven innovation to influence and manage consumer energy demand and to improve network management.  To capitalise on Scotland’s internationally significant hydrogen projects and pilots, we will set in place a coordinated programme of work to upscale opportunities across emerging hydrogen transport markets.

We will also continue to encourage and support ongoing research, development, demonstration, and deployment of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) or Driverless Cars. For example, we are holding a two-day ‘CAV Scotland’ event taking place at the Royal Highland Centre on 30 October and 1 November this year and supporting a collaborative bid to InnovateUK’s ‘CAV4’ call for funding of an autonomous bus demonstrator.   We are also partnering with INRIX on their ‘AV Road Rules’ platform to digitise part of the trunk road network and provide key data on road characteristics and encourage autonomous vehicle developers bring trials and innovative technologies to Scotland.
