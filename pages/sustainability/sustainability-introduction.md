In a world of finite resources there are huge opportunities for the countries and companies which develop new ways to both reduce our demands for natural resources and use resources more productively.

We are the only country in the world with statutory annual greenhouse gas reduction targets, and we have set an ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050.  The economic opportunities here for our most innovative businesses are enormous. We are backing this mission with investment that will stimulate new innovation and private investment. We want to help Scottish businesses and universities to innovate at home and then export their solutions to the rest of the world.
