There is a greater proportion of microenterprises in rural Scotland than anywhere else in the country. By-and-large these enterprises operate a business model where profit margins and turnover are lower, they have slower trajectories for growth, and the levels of self-employment are higher. These enterprises play an important role in their local economy and are a major source of development with growth of £6.6 billion between 2007-2015. There is untapped potential in our rural economy as its true value to the economy of Scotland is under-represented in statistics due to turnover levels of some microenterprises falling below those required for VAT registration.

We are delivering over £119 million of enterprise support through GrowBiz, LEADER, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise to nearly 1,500 community based and/or micro enterprise projects operating in the rural economy.

To achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth in rural areas in the South of Scotland we will create a new enterprise agency in the South of Scotland with an interim Economic Partnership in place, backed with £10 million of investment.

We have pledged £7.5m funding over 2017-2020 towards the Ambition 2030 Food and Drink Industry Strategy to help the sector double its turnover to £30bn by 2030. The strategy contains a range of actions with collaboration between government and industry to support food and drink businesses and help the sector grow. We have published, in collaboration with industry, a number of sectoral action plans covering: fruit and vegetables and potatoes; pigs; and venison; featuring a series of practical actions to drive economic growth in these sectors.
