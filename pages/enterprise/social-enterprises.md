* **We have established a national social enterprise incubator**

In partnership with the social enterprise sector, we published a ten-year social enterprise strategy and, since 2009, we have invested almost £4 million in the Social Entrepreneurs Fund to support social enterprise activity.

We are using the Year of Young People 2018 and our delivery of social enterprise activity in schools and early learning establishments across Scotland to raise awareness of social enterprise as a viable and rewarding career.

We have doubled our seed funding for start-ups from £500,000 to £1 million through our national social enterprise incubator.

We provided over £134,000 funding in 2018-19 to expand the innovative Community Shares Scotland programme, which has helped social entrepreneurs raise more than £10 million for over 100 community projects since 2014.
