In November 2016, Rio Tinto Alcan sold the last remaining aluminium smelter in the UK, in Lochaber, to the GFG Alliance. The Scottish Government supported this transaction as part of a clear commitment to Scotland’s industrial infrastructure and rural economy and to inclusive and sustainable growth in the West Highlands. The continued operation of the smelter and further downstream investment will provide a critical manufacturing anchor creating opportunities in both the local and national economy.

We are committed to doing all we can to ensure a sustainable future for commercial shipbuilding on the Clyde.  Shipbuilding and the wider marine engineering sector play a vital role in sustaining many high-value jobs on the Clyde and elsewhere in Scotland.  This is why, alongside investment from the business owners, we have provided commercial loan facilities of up £45 million to Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited to help the company strengthen and diversify its business.

We wish to see a sustainable future for the Scottish steel sector, building on the long and proud heritage of steelwork in Scotland.  Scottish steel is a quality product, which includes the specialist heavy plate from Liberty Steel in Lanarkshire.  We are working with the sector through the Scottish Steel Round Table, chaired by the Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, to do as much as we can to help lower the barriers to trade and to increase the industry’s ability to compete in local and global markets.  The public sector in Scotland is itself a major customer for steel and our on-line Steel Pipeline publication highlights potential market opportunities for steel producers from public sector projects and programmes.
