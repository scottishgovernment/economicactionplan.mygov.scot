***Making Scotland a world-leading entrepreneurial innovative nation***

- Delivering a ‘CAN DO’ mindset and approach where sustainable growth and innovation go hand in hand with wider benefits to all of society.
- Tackling the entrepreneurial gender gap through our Women in Enterprise Framework and Action Group and associated projects.
- Unlock ambition through our support of programmes such as Scottish EDGE, Converge Challenge and Unlocking Ambition, which backs high potential entrepreneurs to grow their business.

**Scotland CAN DO**  
[Scotland CAN DO](http://www.cando.scot/) is our platform & statement of intent towards becoming a world leading entrepreneurial and innovative nation. It embodies an approach where sustainable growth and innovation go hand in hand with wider benefits to all of society. Co-developed with public, private & third sector partners, CAN DO explicitly supports collaboration amongst partners with a view to collective impact.  

The Unlocking Ambition Challenge provides up to 40 budding entrepreneurs with the best possible advice and support, including tailored training; mentoring from successful business leaders, and access to professional, financial and entrepreneurial networks to help them grow their business. The initial cohort of entrepreneurs have completed their first year within the challenge and have graduated to year two.

The Unlocking Ambition Challenge provides up to 40 budding entrepreneurs with the best possible advice and support, including tailored training; mentoring from successful business leaders, and access to professional, financial and entrepreneurial networks to help them grow their business. The initial cohort of entrepreneurs have completed their first year within the challenge and have graduated to year two.  

This builds on the success of programs such as Scottish EDGE. Launched in 2012 through Scottish Enterprise, then ‘spun-out’ as stand-alone entity supported by RBS, Hunter Foundation and Scottish Government, the [Scottish EDGE](https://scottishedge.com/) Fund embodies the CAN DO approach. Over 15 rounds, over £14 million has been awarded to over 360 businesses.  They in turn have generated £151m of additional turnover, creating over 1,800 jobs as well as raising £124m of additional investment.  

**Women in Enterprise**  
The 2017 Women in Enterprise Framework and Action Plan seeks to realise untapped economic potential by tackling the gender gap across start-ups and growth companies. The Scottish Government is funding a range of programmes to support  more women to set up and succeed in business. The Scottish Government is committed to bringing forward a model to deliver future gender-aware and gender-specific policies and interventions regardless of location or stage on their entrepreneurial journey. This will follow a robust, evidence based approach.  

**Investing in talent**  
While it’s critical to broaden the pool of talent starting and growing new businesses, we need to ensure that we continue to invest in those businesses that have the potential for rapid growth - investing in people, funds and expertise where it can make the most difference. New data capability will enable the enterprise agencies to act on better intelligence to help drive business investment and growth.
