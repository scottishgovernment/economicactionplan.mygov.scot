***Giving small businesses access to cutting-edge research, skills and technology, creating better conditions for them to make their mark in foreign markets and supporting those who want to grow off the scale***

**Knowledge and Expertise**  
We will continue to help small businesses connect to academia and tap into the latest knowledge and technology, helping them boost their productivity, competiveness and growth. We do this by helping fund Innovate UK’s Knowledge Transfer Partnerships and our own Interface through the Scottish Funding Council.  

Our investment in Innovation Centres allows small businesses to capitalise on newly-identified opportunities or improve existing ideas in high-value sectors. Further support will also be available with the creation of the National Manufacturing Institute for Scotland which will create a centre of know-how and shared resources which small businesses will be able to access.  

**Opportunities to Innovate**  
By actively encouraging small businesses to solve public sector challenges, we are helping them bring new ideas to life with the CAN DO Innovation Challenge Fund. CivTech® is partly funded from this and is the world’s first cross-public sector tech accelerator, providing the opportunity to propose and develop solutions to specific problems. Public and private sector opportunities can also be accessed through Open Innovation Challenges.  

**Digital Support**  
We are working closely with partners to equip small businesses with the technology to thrive in the modern digital economy. The national DigitalBoost programme, delivered by Business Gateway and Highlands and Islands Enterprise will continue to provide digital skills-focused advice and support.  

The Digital Development Loan, the first investment of the £36 million Digital Growth Fund, builds on this by offering interest free loans of between £5,000 and £50,000 to help SMEs invest in digital capabilities, processes, skills and capacity.  

Other support comes through the Digital Excellence Centre in Inverness, #HelloDigital, designed to raise awareness of the benefits of digital technology and work led by Highlands and Islands Enterprise to roll out next generation broadband across the region.  They offer a diverse range of targeted programmes related to tourism and cyber resilience.  

A new Digital Start Fund of £1m, launched in May 2019, will provide for the purpose of a more inclusive fund to support those facing barriers such as being out of work and those on low incomes seeking to train in digital skills.  

**Export Growth Plan**  
Small businesses can take advantage of our £20 million investment to increase Scotland’s exports. Available to businesses of all sizes, the 3 year Export Growth Plan is delivering intensive support to 50 high growth exporting businesses per year, creating 100 business-to-business mentorships per year to new exporters, further expanding the network of in-market specialist and increasing access to export finance.  

**More Opportunities to Export**  
More opportunities are being created for all businesses in Scotland to export. We have funded the Scottish chambers of commerce network to deliver a 3 year programme of inward and outward missions aimed specifically at small businesses, created trade envoys to champion export opportunities from home and to identify new opportunities and markets abroad, and created a growing network of Innovation and Investment Hubs which cover Dublin, London, Berlin, Brussels and Paris.  

**Scottish Development International**  
Scottish Development International provide dedicated export advice and support to businesses of all sizes. This includes market research, its Export Advisory Service offering one to one support for those looking to scale up their exports, market intelligence and networks within different regions, grants to new exporters and a range of online resources.  

**Prepare for Brexit**  
We are supporting the multi-agency campaign to help Scotland’s businesses face the challenges of the UK’s exit from the European Union. Prepare for Brexit provides businesses with access to export advisers to create a Brexit-focused action plan, grants of £4000 to identify specific Brexit-related international issues, online learning opportunities, skills workshops, networking events and market research support.  

**Support to Grow Rapidly**  
Scottish Enterprise’s Start2Scale Service provides a dedicated service which focuses on supporting ambitious growth-driven businesses in a closely integrated way across the stages of the scale up journey. It is for highly ambitious, innovative early stage businesses with significant potential to grow sales quickly, typically 20% per annum to excess of £10m in 3-10 years and for more established businesses which are Scottish owned or with strategic direction from within Scotland, currently achieving £10m+ turnover with the ambition and potential to grow to £50m-£100m and beyond within 3-5 years  

Entrepreneurial Scotland facilitate the CAN DO Scale Movement, a network of public and private sector organisations working with businesses to grow at pace. This is open to small businesses and includes the SCALE Summer School, an intensive course with top international educators, and the 18 month Scale Up Scotland programme delivered by leading entrepreneurs.
