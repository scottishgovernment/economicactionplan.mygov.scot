## Scottish National Investment Bank

To improve access to finance for Scottish businesses and transformative projects, we will introduce legislation to enable the establishment and capitalisation of the [Scottish National Investment Bank](https://beta.gov.scot/publications/scottish-national-investment-bank-implementation-plan/). Our aim is for the Bank to be investing in our businesses, communities and transformative projects from 2020 to promote innovative, carbon neutral and inclusive growth.  

## Building Scotland Fund

As a precursor to this, the £150 million [Building Scotland Fund](https://www.mygov.scot/building-scotland-fund/) will provide £70 million in 2018 to 2019 and £80 million over 2019 to 2021 to:
* the development of new affordable and private sector housing;
* the development of modern industrial and commercial property; 
* support industry-led research and development.

## Scottish Growth Scheme

We will also stimulate private and partner investment in innovative and ambitious SMEs by providing microfinance, debt and equity support through the [Scottish Growth Scheme](https://www.mygov.scot/scottish-growth-scheme/). The Scheme has already supported over £100m of investment in businesses and will deliver £500m by June 2020.  

We have promoted financial best practice between businesses by encouraging SMEs to sign up to the [Prompt Payment Code](http://www.promptpaymentcode.org.uk/).
