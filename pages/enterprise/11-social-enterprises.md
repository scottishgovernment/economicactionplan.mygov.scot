***Scotland’s as a world-leading social enterprise nation***

Key points:  

- We have established a 10 year National Social Enterprise Strategy
- Scotland is increasingly recognised as a world leader in developing social enterprise

In partnership with the social enterprise sector, in 2016 we published a ten-year social enterprise strategy and since then have invested £3.5 million in social enterprise activity.  We have also increased our seed funding to £1.5 million for start-ups through our Social Entrepreneurs Fund.  

Since 2017, we have also provided over £409,045 funding to expand the innovative Community Shares Scotland programme. Since 2009, nearly 700 new societies have been created, with over £69 million raised in share capital and a further £100 million in grants, loans and donations.  

Scotland’s approach to social enterprise is increasingly recognised worldwide.  In October 2019 the Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government attended the Social Enterprise World Forum in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to demonstrate our commitment to the sector and its potential for economic impact.

## *case study:*{:.hidden} Positive Changes, Community Interest Company

Positive Changes supports women who have touched the Scottish criminal justice system by helping them towards employment through the making and selling of chocolates.  

It was set up by Joyce Murray, who was working as a volunteer at HMP Cornton Vale Family Hub centre, when she saw first-hand the significant barriers women with convictions face in gaining employment. Having a job plays a key part in reducing the likelihood of reoffending, and she believed she could make a positive change in her community by creating employment opportunities for these women.  

She received £25,000 Build It Award from Firstport, Scotland’s development agency for start-up social entrepreneurs and social enterprises. Joyce said the award came at just the right time as the organisation had been incorporated for just over a year and its market presence was growing, with more and more women accessing its services.  

Positive Changes is now flourishing and has big plans for the future. Joyce said: “I hope we can continue to grow, supporting more and more women and selling more and more chocolates. The criminal justice system for women in Scotland is changing. I would love for Positive Changes to be an integral part of the new offering for women in each of the new Community Custody Units and the National Facility in Scotland.”
