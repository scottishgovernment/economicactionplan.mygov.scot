***Creative industries include screen, digital tech, design and computer games – some of the most dynamic and vibrant sectors of our modern economy***

## Key points:

- Scotland’s creative industries contributed £4.9 billion of GVA to Scotland in 2017, employing 87,000 people.
- The creative sector promotes experimentation and idea generation, it helps drive innovation and transformation, and contributes to Scotland’s international reputation.

Creative industries play a key role in the introduction of new products, new processes and services, and new ways of telling stories. They innovate in form, material, and design, maximising the benefits for industry, the environment and wider society. They can also innovate in new and varied business models and new ways of working, leading the way in adapting to societal changes. We will work to strengthen links and collaborations between different sectors as well as academia and industry, and to support clusters of innovative businesses and industry-led partnerships.  

Providing an important opportunity to build innovation across Scotland’s leading festivals, we will invest a total of £2 million in the Edinburgh Festivals in 2018/19 through the continuation of the EXPO fund. Since 2008 the Scottish Government Expo Fund has supported the delivery and further expansion of Scotland's major festivals‎ with an investment of £21 million, making a massive contribution in cementing Edinburgh's reputation as a world leading festival city.  

We will provide £1 million towards PLACE (Platform for Creative Excellence) partnership in 2018/19. As a 3-way matched funding arrangement between Edinburgh’s Festivals, Scottish Government and City of Edinburgh Council, it will support proposals for strategic development activity across Edinburgh’s festivals.  

The Scottish Government has significantly increased funding for screen production, development and growth since 2017-18 and supported the establishment of Screen Scotland, the dedicated partnership focused on growing our TV and film industry.  New increased funds to support film and television production have been rolled out with a larger Production Growth Fund to attract inward investment and a new television Broadcast Content Fund for television.  

Working with industry, creative practitioners and our partners, we will work to find ways that the sector can effectively engage with the enterprise support system and find the support that meets their needs. We will also work to create the right conditions for peer-to-peer support, partnerships, and creative networks which often build on local culture, history and local distinctiveness to help develop place identity and purpose.
