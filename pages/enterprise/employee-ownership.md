The health of the Scottish economy depends on having a diverse range of business-types. Employee ownership has an important role to play.

We are making it easier for companies and workers to find out more about employee ownership and to move towards it if it’s right for them. Scotland for EO will help to make this into a real option for businesses and workers across Scotland.

There are already around 100 employee and worker owned businesses operating in Scotland with approximately 7,000 employee-owners generating a combined turnover of around £940 million every year.

We aim to increase the number of employee and worker-owned businesses to 500 by 2030 through the newly-established ‘Scotland for EO’ – an industry leadership group with the aim of making Scotland the best country in the world for employee owned (EO) businesses.

Scottish Enterprise is running a series of workshops explaining employee ownership to build awareness and demand for this inclusive business model.
