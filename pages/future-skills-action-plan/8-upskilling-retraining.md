Between 2016-2041, Scotland’s working age population is expected to grow by 1% compared with 8% in the UK. This  trend is one reason why we need to enhance access to upskilling, reskilling and retraining opportunities so that individuals are able to successfully gain new skills regardless of age or current qualification levels.

Between 2011 and 2015 Scottish employers decreased their spending on training by 8%. Reversing this trend creates an opportunity to reinforce a culture of investment in human capital as a means of both increasing productivity and ensure both Scottish employers and employees are prepared for new and potentially unpredicted challenges and opportunities ahead.

We will work with employers, and other system stakeholders, to arrest the reductions in workforce development by employers observed within Scotland over the last decade. 

**Next steps**

2.1) Through the National Retraining Partnership, with CBI Scotland and Scottish Trade Unions Congress we will engage businesses, workers and wider stakeholders to identify how reskilling and upskilling opportunities can deliver the skills needs of Scotland’s future  workforce. 

2.2) Following the completion of Skills Development Scotland’s Careers Information and Guidance Review, we will publish a Careers Strategy later in 2019 to support learners and workers in making more informed career choices through-out their lives. 

2.3) Through the Skills Action Plan for Rural Scotland we are  improving access to work-based learning, education and skills training across the rural economy.

2.4)  We will provide more opportunities for the current workforce to upskill and reskill, and improve the delivery of those opportunities to both employers and workers. As a first step, we will increase our investment in Individual Training Accounts and the Flexible Workforce Development Fund to £20m in 2020/21 to drive the alignment of our support for the existing workforce, recognising the potential this creates to leverage additional support for those in work.

2.5) As it becomes established, the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland (NMIS) Manufacturing Skills Academy will develop a catalogue of advanced manufacturing modules to understand and cater to needs across the sector.
