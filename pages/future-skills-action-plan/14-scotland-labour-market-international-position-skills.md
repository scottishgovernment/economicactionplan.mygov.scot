Scotland’s labour market is in a strong position with a record high employment rate (75.9%, Feb-April) and record low unemployment rate (3.1%, Jan-Mar 19).

Furthermore, labour market records have also been broken for women and young people. Between February and April 2019, the employment rate for women in Scotland reached a record high of 72.7% and the unemployment rate for young people (16-24) fell to a record low of 6.1%.  
Across a number of key labour market indicators Scotland has out-performed the UK as a whole. As of August 2019  unemployment in Scotland has been lower than in the UK for the previous 11 months and July’s labour market statistics (for Mar-May ’19) showed Scotland out-performed the UK on employment, unemployment and inactivity rates for women and young people.

- Scotland is ranked 1st out of 36 OECD countries in terms of high-level qualifications;
- In Scotland more people (47.4%) aged 25-64 are educated to tertiary level (levels 5-8) than any other country in Europe.
- Almost half (48.9%) of workers aged 16-64 years in Scotland have further or higher education qualifications (SCQF level 7+) compared to 38.2% in 2008 and 44.3% across the UK
- Between 2008 and 2018 the percentage of Scotland’s population with low (SCQF level 4 or below) or no qualifications fell from 16.3% to 11.6%.

Increasing skills levels mirror enhanced access to education. In 2017-18 15.6% of undergraduate students starting a full-time degree came from Scotland’s 20% most deprived areas, representing an increase of over 4 percentage points on the 2006-07 figure of 11.4%. Concurrently, the number of full-time FE college students from Scotland’s 20% most deprived areas rose by 3.3 percentage points to 34.1%: the highest on record.

However, even as access to formal education has increased, in-work training had fallen across all age groups. In 2018, 25.4% of 16-24 year old workers received training at work, down from 35.2% a decade earlier and for 50-64 year olds the proportion fell from 23.5% to 20.2%.
