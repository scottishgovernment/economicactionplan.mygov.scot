Given employment powers remain with Westminster, our approach to delivering Fair Work is built on collaboration, engagement, and using our wider powers and policies to exert strategic influence.  While more can be done, we should recognise the progress that has been made through this partnership approach, including:
* Meeting and exceeding our target of 1000 Scots-based [living wage accredited employers](https://scottishlivingwage.org/) (now over 1300).
* Almost 600 [Scottish Business Pledge](https://scottishbusinesspledge.scot/) signatories.
* Introducing [Statutory Guidance on Addressing Fair Work Practices, including the real Living Wage, in Procurement](https://www.gov.scot/publications/statutory-guidance-selection-tenderers-award-contracts-addressing-fair-work-practices/) and supporting [Best Practice Guidance](https://beta.gov.scot/publications/addressing-fair-work-practices-including-real-living-wage-procurement-best/) and [Toolkit](https://beta.gov.scot/publications/addressing-fair-work-practices-including-real-living-wage-procurement-best/).
* Introducing the [Workplace Equality Fund](https://www.impactfundingpartners.com/our-funds/workplace-equality-fund) to deliver employer-led innovative solutions to overcome workforce inequality. 
* Introducing the [Women Returners Programme](http://www.employabilityinscotland.com/key-clients/women-and-work/women-returners/) to assist women to re-enter the workforce following a career break.
* Establishing the [Carer Positive](http://www.carerpositive.org/) scheme to encourage flexible, fair and supportive policies to support carers in the workforce.
* Promoting development of flexible workplaces through continued funding of [Family Flexible Working Scotland](https://www.familyfriendlyworkingscotland.org.uk/).
* Collaborating with the [Scottish Trades Union Congress](http://www.stuc.org.uk/) (STUC) to publishing the [Severe Weather Charter](https://www.gov.scot/publications/severe-weather-charter/) which sets out Fair Work principles to help employers manage severe weather situations.
* Jointly publishing the [Facility Time Reporting Guidance](https://www.gov.scot/publications/guidance-facility-time-reporting-public-sector-employers/) with the STUC.
* Reaching a Fair Work Agreement between Scottish Ministers and Civil Service Trade Unions.
