During the development of the [Fair Work Framework](https://www.fairworkconvention.scot/the-fair-work-framework/), the social care sector was identified as having significant strengths and best practice but was also recognised as being under some strain, with significant challenges to Fair Work being experienced by many frontline staff in the sector.  The Fair work Convention noted the lack of security for social care staff;  poor terms and conditions; significant difficulties in staff recruitment and retention; and commissioning / procurement practices which seem to work against both Fair Work and person-centred care.   The Convention, therefore, undertook an Inquiry into Fair Work in Social Care and published its report on 26 February 2019. 

The Scottish Government will respond to the recommendations set out in the Fair Work Conventionâ€™s Social Care Inquiry Report.  A key recommendation is to establish a forum to agree minimum standards for the sector that can be incorporated into the commissioning process.  The Scottish Government has accepted this key recommendation and will work with industry partners to establish the forum in early 2019.
