We will work with the Fair Work Convention to organise and host an international Fair Work Summit in 2019/20.  The Summit will showcase Scotlandâ€™s approach to Fair Work on an international stage, making connections across the Fair Work movement in Scotland, the UK and Europe.  This will also provide opportunity to enhance collaboration with European partners in order to secure a continued focus on Fair Work after EU exit.
