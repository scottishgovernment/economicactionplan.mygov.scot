The [Programme for Government for 2016-17](https://www.gov.scot/publications/plan-scotland-scottish-governments-programme-scotland-2016-17/) recognised that the labour market does not provide good outcomes for many equality groups, and committed to establishing the Workplace Equality Fund. In 2018, the Â£500,000 which the Scottish Government committed to the [Workplace Equality Fund](https://www.impactfundingpartners.com/our-funds/workplace-equality-fund) supported employers across a range of sectors to make innovative changes which are benefiting both employers and workers. 

In 2019/20, we will expand the Workplace Equality Fund to enable us to work with more employers to address long-standing barriers in the labour market so that everyone has the opportunity to fulfil their potential.  This Fund will enable businesses with innovative ideas to embed the dimensions of the Fair Work Framework in their workplaces.
