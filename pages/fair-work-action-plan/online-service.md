During 2019, we will work with employers and employer organisations to develop support for small and micro employers seeking to adopt Fair Work practices in their businesses.  This action recognises the challenges that smaller employers face, particularly those without dedicated human resource departments or employees.  

The support will include access to online advice, linked to the Enterprise and Skills single portal, and will build on existing networks to bring information and advice into a coherent, accessible and sustainable gateway.
