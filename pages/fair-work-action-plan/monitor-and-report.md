Building on the National Performance Framework and working with the Fair Work Convention, the Scottish Government will develop and adopt a set of indicators to measure progress in delivering a Fair Work Nation.  

The Fair Work and Gender Ministerial Working Group will provide a challenge function to the action being taken.  

The Scottish Government will also seek to provide the Scottish Parliament with annual reports on progress in embedding Fair Work via the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work Committee and the Finance Committee in respect of the Fair Work budget, with the first report being provided in March 2020.
