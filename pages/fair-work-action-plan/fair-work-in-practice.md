The [Fair Work Agreement](https://www.gov.scot/publications/fair-work-agreement-between-scottish-ministers-and-the-recognised-civil-service-unions/) was signed in November 2018 by Derek Mackay, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work and the recognised Civil Service Trade Unions.  It illustrates the commitment to embedding Fair Work into local employment policy and practice in the Civil Service sector.

All public bodies in Scotland are encouraged to work with their trade union partners to adopt the terms of the agreement.

The agreement aligns with the Fair Work Conventionâ€™s [Framework](https://www.fairworkconvention.scot/the-fair-work-framework/) and promotes work that offers:

- respect
- opportunity
- fulfilment
- security
- effective voice
