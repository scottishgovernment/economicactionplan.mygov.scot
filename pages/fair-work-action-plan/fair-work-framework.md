We will work with the [Fair Work Convention](https://www.fairworkconvention.scot/) to develop a tool that will allow all employers to benchmark their policies and practices against the dimensions of the [Fair Work Framework](https://www.fairworkconvention.scot/the-fair-work-framework/).  This tool will encourage employers to critically assess their organisations in order to better understand their strengths and weaknesses.  

The benchmarking tool will identify practical steps that employers can take to progress their Fair Work journey and will signpost the employer to further advice and support.
