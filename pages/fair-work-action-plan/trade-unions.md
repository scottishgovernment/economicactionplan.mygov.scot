In 2019/20, we will provide the [Scottish Trades Union Congress](http://www.stuc.org.uk/) (STUC) with additional funding to support a further round of the Fair Work and Trade Union Modernisation Fund to support unions embed the [Fair Work Framework](https://www.fairworkconvention.scot/the-fair-work-framework/) in workplaces in Scotland. 

We will also provide the STUC with additional funding to support the 2019/20 STUCâ€™s [Fair Work: Leadership and Equality Programme](https://www.scottishunionlearning.com/funding-fairwork/).
