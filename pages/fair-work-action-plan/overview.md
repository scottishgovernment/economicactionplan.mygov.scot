## Supporting employers adopt Fair Work practices
We recognise that there are challenging times ahead. By working in partnership with employers, workers and trade unions, we aim to build on the extensive evidence base that demonstrates Fair Work is good for business and that by embedding Fair Work in workplaces now, businesses are more likely to benefit from sustainable growth.    

We are committed to working with employer organisations to implement the Fair Work Action Plan.  We will also work with the Fair Work Convention to promote understanding and application of the Fair Work Framework in workplaces across the country.  The Fair Work Convention’s 2019/20 work plan also focuses on employer engagement.

The Scottish Government is already working with business in a number of important areas including:
* Establishing the Scottish National Investment Bank and National Manufacturing Institute for Scotland.
* Creating a single digital portal for business support – spanning our agencies and simplifying and accelerating the process of accessing our support. 
* Launching £20 million of support to businesses looking to increase exports. 
* Showcasing Scottish businesses and assets to investors and people around the world, through the Scotland is Now campaign.
* Committing over £1 billion to deliver 100% coverage of city region growth deals throughout Scotland and supporting a diverse and vibrant rural economy.
* Expanding the role of the CAN DO Business Innovation Forum to enable it to consider and take action on the economic opportunities and challenges of new technologies.
* Supporting Entrepreneurial Scotland to play a broader role in helping Scotland become a world-leading entrepreneurial and innovative society.
* Launching a ‘Come to Scotland campaign’ to attract talent and investment and help mitigate the impact of Brexit.

In response to employer engagement already undertaken, we are committing to a suite of actions to support employers adopt and benefit from fairer workplace practices.

## Embedding Fair Work across the Scottish Government 
The Enterprise and Skills Board’s Strategic Plan recommended that the “Scottish Government will embed progressive business models, workplace innovation and Fair Work in all instruments of government and agencies, ensuring business support is conditional upon a commitment to Fair Work”.

Our commitment to Fair Work First is an important statement of our intent.  

Embedding Fair Work across all of our functions will be challenging.  To support that process, we will take the following actions:

<hr>
**We will:**
* **Ensure continued Ministerial direction and support through Fair Work and Gender Equality Ministerial Working Group**
* **Appoint a Scottish Government Fair Work Champion**
* **Develop Directorate-level Fair Work Action Plans**
* **Work with the Fair Work Convention to develop a Fair Work narrative and communications plan**
* **Engage with the UK Government and devolved nations on Fair Work and employment law**
* **Demonstrate leadership as an employer**
* **Measure, monitor and report on progress in delivering a Fair Work Nation**
