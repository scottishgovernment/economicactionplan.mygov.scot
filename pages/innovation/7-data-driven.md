We will help to grow the cyber security industry in Scotland by providing funding that will support Scotland in their role as a cluster management organisation to formalise and develop Scotland's cyber cluster We will also support defined learning pathways into cyber security careers (including for career changers) and support for children and young people to develop key cyber skills.
