## Key points:

* Scotland’s creative industries contributed £4.4 billion of GVA to Scotland in 2016, employing 84,000 people.
* The creative sector promotes experimentation and idea generation, it helps drive innovation and transformation, and contributes to Scotland’s international reputation.

We will work with industry to promote the value of design, use of design thinking, and build design capability across sectors. We have supported the development of the iconic V&A Dundee, Scotland’s first design museum, which will provide significant economic benefit through employment generation and contributing to Scotland’s international reputation.  

Providing an important opportunity to build innovation across Scotland’s leading festivals, we are investing a total of £2 million in the Edinburgh Festivals over 2019/20 through the continuation of the EXPO fund. Since 2008 the Scottish Government Expo Fund has supported the delivery and further expansion of Scotland’s major festivals‎ with an investment of £25 million, making a massive contribution in cementing Edinburgh’s reputation as a world leading festival city.  

Each EXPO award is to put Scottish artists on an international platform, whether that is though commissions, showcasing or talent development.  The Scottish Government EXPO fund is all about investing in work and talent to have international exposure through the industry and audiences we attract.  Since 2008 we have invested £25m to ensure Scotland has its rightful place in world culture and will continue to do so.  

We will provide £1 million towards PLACE (Platforms for Creative Excellence) partnership in 2019/20. As a 3-way matched funding arrangement between Edinburgh’s Festivals, Scottish Government and City of Edinburgh Council, it will support proposals for strategic development activity across Edinburgh’s festivals.  

Scottish Government has significantly increased funding in 2018-19 for screen production, development and growth, doubling the screen budget to £20 million. New increased funds to support film and television production have been rolled out this year with a larger Production Growth Fund to attract inward investment and a new television Broadcast Content Fund for television.  

We are providing £475,000 to support the National Film and Television School to set up a base in Scotland that will help people in the screen sector move up the career ladder and employers to address skills gaps.

The UK’s most northerly mainland distillery, Dunnet Bay in Caithness, is offering its Rock Rose Gin in fully recyclable pouches, an innovation which is the first of its kind in the UK.  

Once empty, customers can return the pouches via freepost back to the distillery, where they are collected by innovative recycling company, TerraCycle, and recycled into new items.  

The green innovation was developed by Dunnet Bay Distillers in partnership with global innovation and transformation consultancy PA Consulting, with support from Highlands and Islands Enterprise.  

Following over 12 months of research and development, PA created a lightweight refill solution for customers to use to refill their current bottles. The four-layer laminate pouch was designed to lock in all the freshness of the gin, with an easy-to-use plastic spout closure.  

The sustainable packaging can be both delivered and returned through a letterbox, weighs 65 grams rather than 700 grams for a bottle, and significantly reduces the energy spent in shipping Rock Rose Gin to customers. The distillery hopes to have a fully biodegradable refill by 2025.  

The launch is the latest in a raft of green initiatives from the distillery. It’s already part-powered via solar panels and has ambitions to be a net producer of electricity by the end of 2020.  

Martin Murray, co-founder of Dunnet Bay Distillers, said: “We take sustainability incredibly seriously and have been working hard on our first-to-market recyclable pouches. In the near future we plan to extend the scheme to bars, restaurants and shops, as well as making it available across all the spirits in our portfolio.”
