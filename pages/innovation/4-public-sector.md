***Driving innovation through procurement of public services***

## Key points:

* Boosting NHS collaboration with industry to deliver innovation and better outcomes for patients
* Enhancing the CAN DO Innovation Challenge Fund and launching an open innovation portal that will deliver easy access for business to public sector innovation challenge opportunities across Scotland
* Delivering ‘Procurement Innovation Partnerships’ which will streamline how the Scottish public sector and business collaborate on the procurement and dissemination of innovation.

We are committed to increasing the value of NHS collaborative innovation.  NHS Scotland invests £70.3 million a year to support research & development and innovation.  In 2017-18 this included support for 330 commercial clinical trials.  Further investment from 2018-19 will provide more effective support for health innovation, in part through the development of Test Beds to support health innovation partnerships between NHSScotland and industry.  

The Attend Anywhere Video Consultation Platform will continue to provide greater options for people in Scotland in how they wish to access health and care services and will be extended to primary care and social care. This will support a reduction in travel costs, reduction in emissions and support more flexible working practices.  

We have also secured the inaugural UCI Cycling World Championships for Scotland in 2023 which will see individual world championships taking place concurrently in 13 different cycling disciplines at venues across the country.  This is a tribute to our international reputation in hosting major and innovative events.  We aim to use the World Championships as a catalyst to deliver wider behavioural change that moves Scotland to become a Cycling Nation.  

We are improving people’s lives with better, faster and easier public service products through CivTech and have delivered the first two CivTech® cohorts, which have seen the participating companies to date win over £1.75m in contracts after the programme, create new jobs and secure equity investment.   The next round of 11 challenges has elicited 129 applications from across the UK and the CivTech model is sparking interest across the world.  

We will set up Procurement Innovation Partnerships to work collaboratively with public bodies to procure new goods and services to solve social challenges, creating opportunities for SMEs.
