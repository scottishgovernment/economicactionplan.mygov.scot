## Parental Employment

We will invest £12 million in intensive parental employment support to help parents on low incomes move into employment and progress their careers when already in work, as part of our focus on child poverty.

## Gender Pay Gap 

Our Gender Pay Gap Working Group includes expert stakeholders such as Close the Gap, Engender and the STUC. Chaired by the Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, the group will develop a coordinated cross-government action plan to reduce gender pay gaps across sectors, as a key element of the Scottish Government’s inclusive growth vision.

The First Minister’s National Advisory Council on Women and Girls was formed as a catalyst for change to address gender inequality by providing independent strategic advice to the First Minister. Their vision is of a Scotland which is recognised as a world leader, for its commitment and action towards realising an equal society where all women and girls can reach their true potential.

We will invest an additional £5 million over the next 3 years to support around 2,000 women to return to work.  We will also commit £250,000 over two years to develop Women in Agriculture Leadership and establish a Leadership Development Programme, improving training across the country for women involved in farming and crofting and developing a Charter for Equality.

## Disability Employment 

We will publish a Disability Employment Action Plan setting out steps towards achieving our ambition to reduce the disability employment gap by at least half.

We will take a joined up approach across our public services to help people with a health issue or disability stay in work by piloting a Health and Work Support service. We also aim to provide 300 Allied Healthcare Professionals with National Institute of Disability Management and Research training so that they can support people to remain in or return to work as part of a 5 year programme.  

## Mental Health

We are enabling those in our hardest to reach, isolated areas who are suffering with mental health issues to engage with the jobs market and contribute to the economy through our support for the National Rural Mental Health Forum.

## Health and Work Support

We are taking a joined up approach across our public services to help keep people in work by piloting a Health and Work Support service in Dundee and Fife, set to run until June 2020. This tests a single, easy to navigate, entry point for health and work services to reduce length of sickness absences and the risk of job loss.

We will implement the recommendations of the Commission on Widening Access to support delivery of our ambition for 20% of entrants to university to be from the 20% most deprived areas by 2030.
