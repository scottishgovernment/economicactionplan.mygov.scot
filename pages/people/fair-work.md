## Fair Work Nation

To boost productivity, competitiveness and inclusive growth and to develop Scotland as a world-leading Fair Work Nation we will publish a Fair Work Action Plan by the end of 2018 that will set out the next steps we will take with employers to embed Fair Work practices in Scottish workplaces by 2025. The Action Plan will take account of a recent review of the Scottish Business Pledge and on the successes so far to advance the Living Wage with the aim of extending this further still.

## Fair Work Convention

The [Fair Work Convention](http://www.fairworkconvention.scot/)’s vision, which the Scottish Government shares, is that by 2025 people in Scotland will have a world-leading working life where fair work drives success, wellbeing and prosperity for individuals, businesses, organisations and society. The Fair Work Action Plan will set out the next steps we will take with the powers open to us to embed Fair Work practices in Scottish workplaces. 

## Scottish Business Pledge

We are introducing fair work criteria from the [Scottish Business Pledge](https://scottishbusinesspledge.scot/), including paying the living wage, excluding exploitative zero hours contracts and gender pay gap transparency to business support grants through Regional Selective Assistance and other large Scottish Enterprise job-related grants.

## ‘Fair Work First’ 

Our target is that by the end of this Parliament, we will have extended fair work criteria to every type of grant, funding stream and business support budget open to us. We will also extend the range of Scottish Government and public sector contracts that fair work criteria will apply to. Our ‘Fair Work First’ approach will be developed with trade unions, business and the public sector.

We are exploring options to develop support and advice for small, micro and Business Pledge employers to support fair work practices in their businesses including employing disadvantaged groups.
