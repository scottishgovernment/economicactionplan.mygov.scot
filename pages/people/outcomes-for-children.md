* **The Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017 sets out our ambition for reducing and ultimately eradicating child poverty**
* **Spend on early learning and childcare will more than double to reach nearly £1 billion a year by 2021-22**
* **£750 million over this Parliament to tackle the poverty-related attainment gap**

Our child poverty legislation, and the action plan ‘Every Child, Every Chance’, focus on lifting children and families out of poverty, driven by our vision of genuinely inclusive economic growth. The plan is backed by a range of investments including the £50 million Tackling Child Poverty Fund.

We have already increased the provision of high quality funded early learning and childcare entitlement to 600 hours a year for all 3 and 4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds.

We will more than double spend on early learning and childcare to reach nearly £1 billion a year by the end of this parliament as we implement our commitment to provide a funded entitlement to 1140 hours of ELC for all 3 and 4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds. This will improve outcomes for all children, especially those who are more vulnerable or disadvantaged, and help to close the attainment gap. ELC will also support parents to work, train or study, especially those who need help with finding sustainable employment. Increasing the entitlement will require a substantially larger workforce, significant investment in infrastructure, and new, innovative models of delivery.

We will provide £750 million through the Scottish Attainment Challenge during the course of this parliament to tackle the poverty-related attainment gap to ensure that all our young people develop the skills required to thrive in life.

We are supporting Young Enterprise Scotland to deliver ‘Scotland’s Enterprising Schools’ to ensure a future involving enterprising activity is valid and viable for all young Scots.
