***Attracting talent to Scotland***

## Key points:

* Push the UK Government to recognise the action that is needed to protect Scotland’s prosperity and wellbeing 
* Build on the success of the ‘We are Scotland’ social media campaign
* Bring forward an Electoral Franchise Bill
* We will launch a ‘Come to Scotland campaign’ to attract talent and investment 

To attract talent to Scotland and grow our population (including as part of the repopulation of our rural areas) we need a migration system which reflects Scotland’s distinct needs. The recent report from the Migration Advisory Committee confirmed evidence from the Scottish Government about the positive impact of EEA nationals to our economy, our public services and our communities.  

We will continue to push the UK Government to recognise the action that is needed to protect Scotland’s prosperity and wellbeing. Scottish Ministers should have the powers to tailor migration policy, within a UK framework to meet Scotland’s distinct needs.  

We will now build on the success of the ‘We are Scotland’ social media campaign to launch a ‘Come to Scotland campaign’ to attract talent and investment.  

In addition, we have brought forward the Scottish Elections (Franchise and Representation) Bill which if passed will give fair access to voting rights for all those who have a legal right to live in Scotland.
