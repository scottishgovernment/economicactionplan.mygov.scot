***Building stronger local partnerships to achieve greater impact***

## Key points:

* A new generation of Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) will develop more inclusive and energetic partnerships to increase impact.  

We continue to support a new generation of Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) that will have much greater capacity through wider public, private and community partnerships. These will be are more strategic and sustainable, and contribute to inclusive growth.

We have also launched a pilot Digital Improvement District (DID) model, a BID dedicated to digital improvements, to model the delivery of digital infrastructure and Wi-Fi within towns through strategic collaborations and partnerships with local businesses, agencies and communities to best meet their needs.
