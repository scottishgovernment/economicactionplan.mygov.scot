We are delivering an approach to regeneration that focuses on inclusive growth and supports local aspirations, involves local communities and increases opportunities to attract investment and jobs to disadvantaged and fragile rural areas.

We will stimulate inclusive growth through the Regeneration Capital Grant Fund in partnership with local government, and the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund, bringing vacant and derelict land and buildings back into use, developing business space as well as supporting community facilities and local services.

We will provide new loan investment for commercial projects which support inclusive economic growth, utilising recycled funds through our SPRUCE investment loan fund.

We will continue our sponsorship of Clyde Gateway and pilot actions to increase local spend by anchor institutions through procurement techniques and supporting local suppliers.

Communities are a key driver for inclusive growth and provide opportunities for employment, networking and social interaction.  Through our Empowering Communities we will continue to support community-led action to deliver inclusive growth.
