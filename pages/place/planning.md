## National Planning Framework 4

We will use the National Planning Framework 4 to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth across all of our regions, and to create high-quality, diverse and sustainable places that promote wellbeing and attract investment.

## Strategic Transport Projects Review 

Future transport investment through Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR2), will be aligned with the national planning framework, creating well connected places for the people of Scotland.

## Planning Fees Regulations 

We will consult on a review of our planning fees regulations, including the principle for a developer to pay a higher planning application fee for an accelerated service from the planning authority in its handling of the application.

## Place Principle

We will support and promote the Place Principle which asks that all those responsible for providing services and looking after assets in a place work and plan together, with local communities, to create more successful places.

Through the Local Governance Review, we will consider proposals for alternative governance arrangements at local council / Community Planning Partnership level, or more regionally. A key objective will be to help drive inclusive growth in those places.
