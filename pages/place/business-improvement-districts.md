* **A new generation of Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) will develop more inclusive and energetic partnerships to increase impact.**


<hr>

There are currently 40 BIDs  operating throughout Scotland. We will create a new generation of BIDs, with wider reach and impact. These will build much greater capacity through stronger public, private and community partnerships which are more strategic and sustainable  and better align with inclusive growth and regeneration ambitions, contributing to the vibrancy, vitality and viability of town centres, neighbourhoods and regions.

We have also launched a pilot Digital Improvement District (DID) model, a BID dedicated to digital improvements, to model the delivery of digital infrastructure and Wi-Fi within towns through strategic collaborations and partnerships with local businesses, agencies and communities to best meet their needs.
