***Supporting places to thrive throughout Scotland: in our regions, cities, towns and the rural economy***

We recognise that a ‘one-size fits all’ approach to sustainable and inclusive growth can have unintended consequences. Supporting businesses and growth across all of Scotland, requires us to tailor our actions to address specific conditions in our sectors, regions and rural economy.  

We are improving regional economies through our City Region and other regional growth deals and through transformational investment across all of Scotland.  Whether urban, rural or island we know that with ambition, and the right support, communities can develop and regenerate places and spaces where they live and make them even better.  

We are putting into practice the key aims of the [Place Principle](https://www.gov.scot/publications/place-principle-introduction/) to ensure a joined-up, collaborative, and participative approach to services, land and buildings, across all sectors within a place. This includes supporting the development of a pipeline of strategic sites from the regional city deal commitments.
