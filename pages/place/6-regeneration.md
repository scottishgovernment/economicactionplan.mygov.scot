***Place-based policy to tackle inequality and supports local aspirations***

## Key Points:

* Stimulating inclusive growth through the Regeneration Capital Grant Fund and the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund
* Provide investment for commercial projects through our SPRUCE investment loan fund

We are delivering an approach to regeneration that focuses on inclusive growth and supports local aspirations, involves local communities and increases opportunities to attract investment and jobs to disadvantaged and fragile rural areas.  

We will stimulate inclusive growth through the Regeneration Capital Grant Fund and the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund to support and create jobs, build sustainable communities.  
We will also provide investment through SPRUCE (Scottish Partnership for Regeneration in Urban Centres) for regeneration, property and sustainable energy projects that deliver inclusive growth.  

We will continue our sponsorship of Clyde Gateway and support its approaches to attracting other inward investment to the area to deliver inclusive growth.

Furthermore, we will provide £10m through the Scottish Land Fund to support communities who want to buy land or buildings to use for the long-term benefit of the community.  

Communities are a key driver for inclusive growth and provide opportunities for employment, networking and social interaction.  Through our Empowering Communities Programme, we will continue to support community-led action to deliver inclusive growth.

## *case study:*{:.hidden} Barclays world-class campus takes shape in Glasgow

Glasgow’s financial services sector received a major boost after Barclays announced plans to develop a new 5000-person campus on the banks for the River Clyde.  

Barclays operates in 40 countries across the world, and the development in Glasgow will sit alongside Whippany in New Jersey and Pune in India as part of a global strategy to create world-class facilities for the bank’s functions, technology and operations teams.  

It is expected that once completed, the campus will be able to accommodate up to 2,500 additional roles, doubling Barclays’ current workforce in Scotland and making the bank one of Glasgow’s biggest commercial employers.  At least 42 per cent of the new jobs will be high value, and at least 341 will be for disadvantaged workers or those who have a disability.  

Paul Compton, chief operating officer at Barclays, said: "This new campus is a flagship project for the bank, which builds on Barclays’ long history in Scotland and clearly demonstrates our commitment to supporting the UK economy.  This is a fantastic opportunity to deepen our close ties with local communities and academic institutions to attract and retain the very best talent. It will be somewhere that our colleagues are incredibly proud to work."
