We fully support and promote the [Place Principle](https://www.gov.scot/publications/place-principle-introduction/) which asks that all those responsible for providing services and looking after assets in a place need to work and plan together, and with local communities, to improve the lives of people, support inclusive growth and create more successful places.  

**Bus Priority Investment**  
We are bringing forward transformational long term funding for bus transport of over half a billion pounds, through a Bus Partnership Fund for local authorities, and the roll out of infrastructure for the trunk road network to prioritise high occupancy vehicles.  The draft National Transport Strategy is clear that buses are a key part of our future sustainable public transport offering. We need to address the impacts of congestion on bus services and get more people to make sustainable multi-modal journeys.  

**West Highland transport network**  
We will review the services on the West Highland rail corridor to find opportunities to integrate rail services with other transport modes, as well as active travel. These will boost the local and regional economy, help to develop sustainable tourism and improve connectivity for local communities and the islands. We will publish our proposals for future improvements in Autumn 2020.  

**South West Scotland rail improvements**  
We will identify opportunities on the railway lines between Ayr and Stranraer, and Kilmarnock and Carlisle, to improve performance and journey times. We will identify rail-related initiatives that seek to exploit the economic and social value of these rail lines for the benefit of local communities and the wider economy. We will publish an action plan of improvements in Autumn 2020.
