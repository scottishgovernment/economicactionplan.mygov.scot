## Key points:

* Investing over £1 billion in 2018-19 in Scotland’s universities. 
* Funding of over £600m in 2019-20 to deliver at least 116,000 full-time equivalent college places
* Implementing the recommendations of the Learner Journey review and better aligning the education and skills system.

We have invested over £1 billion every year since 2012-13 in our universities. This has enabled us to maintain free tuition fees for eligible students, while maintaining the high quality of education and ensuring that core outcomes are met and protected. Over 2019-20 we are providing for over 128,000 funded places for eligible students in our universities.  

We are providing funding of over £600m in 2019-20 to colleges to enable tens of thousands of young and adult learners to obtain recognised vocational qualifications each year, increasing routes to work and higher level study.  

Following the independent review of further and higher education student support, we have committed additional investment of £21 million per year by the end of this parliamentary term for improvements to student support. We also provide Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) to young people from low income families to help them stay on in post-16 education either at school or college.  
We published our STEM Education and Training Strategy in October 2017, including making the achievement of a wider range of STEM skills in our young people a priority.  We are prioritising STEM subjects in our colleges and universities and higher level apprenticeships.  

We will accelerate the pace of implementation of the recommendations of the Learner Journey review to ensure the swifter alignment of the education and skills system, to better deliver on improved learner choice and greater system efficiency.  

A pilot phase of the NMIS Manufacturing Skills Academy is delivering a programme of industry doctorate projects, with 24 studentships covering six universities and 11 different industry sectors awarded so far.  A further call for six additional projects closed at the end of October 2019, bringing the total to 30 doctorate projects. The pilot will also deliver Continuous Professional Development (CPD) modules for upskilling and re-training industry professionals, with the first module delivered by the end of October 2019.
