An unprecedented rate of technological change is driving change in the workplace, and an urgent need for more flexible ways to upskill and retrain people.  We will play our part in delivering this change, and will ask our partners, in further and higher education and in business and employer organisations to work with us to deliver the change we need on the ground.
