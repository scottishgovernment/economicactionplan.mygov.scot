## Key points:

* Investing £214 million in Skills Development Scotland
* 30,000 Apprenticeships by 2020, developing the Apprenticeship pathway through Foundation, Modern, and Graduate Apprenticeships.

We are investing £214 million in Skills Development Scotland in 2019/20 to deliver interventions including Modern Apprenticeships, Foundation Apprenticeships, Graduate Apprenticeships, pre-employment training and careers services, and to play a central role in the implementation of Developing the Young Workforce (DYW).

As part of this investment, to ensure Scotland’s labour market is equipped with the skills required we will continue to improve opportunities for apprenticeships, delivering 30,000 Apprenticeships by 2020. This will include developing the Apprenticeship pathway through Foundation, Modern, and Graduate Apprenticeships.

We will expand the number and range of Foundation Apprenticeships, helping to equip more young people at school with industry recognised qualifications, skills, and the practical experience that industry demands, both now and in the future.  We will also continue to develop our Graduate Apprenticeship programmes, offering the opportunity to blend academic learning with practical experience, supporting the in-work development of graduates with the skills that employers require.

    <h2 class="ds_callout__title">Craft beer specialist Brewdog apprenticeship programme</h2>
</header>

<div class="ds_callout__content">
<p>In 2015, Brewdog made use of Skills Development Scotland’s Skills for Growth initiative, which provides free consultancy and support to identify growth priorities.</p>
<p>As a result, the Aberdeenshire-based brewer recruited 20 Modern Apprentices across its business along with a ‘Happiness Manager’ to handle training and development for its predominately young workforce.</p>
<p>In the four years since, BrewDog has raised millions of pounds through equity crowdfunding, opened breweries overseas and is recognised as one of the fastest growing food and drink businesses in the UK.</p>
<p>Now the company is embracing other exciting opportunities through the apprenticeship family by supporting 31-year-old Louise Wyllie through a four-year Graduate Apprenticeship in Business Management at Robert Gordon University.</p>
<p>Louise is employed as a senior customer service specialist by the multinational brewery. Her apprenticeship will see her complete an honours degree within the workplace, with the support of a dedicated mentor at BrewDog and support staff at the university.</p>
<p>Louise had been working as a senior UK customer service specialist for three years, before becoming the company’s UK customer service team lead. She sees her apprenticeship as a key part of her career progression.</p>
<p>She said: "I would definitely recommend Graduate Apprenticeships to others who are looking to further their career and expand their experience while working. Being able to take the theory you learn and immediately put it to use in your day job is very rewarding."</p>
