***Ensuring that as many people as possible benefit from work***

## Key points:

* Investing almost £60 million over 2 years in continued Employability programmes (CJS, Inspiring Scotland, Employability Fund, DYP), aimed at supporting young people facing multiple barriers to employment with a view to moving funding to the No-One Left Behind Employability Funding Stream by 2021-22.
* Our employment support service - Fair Start Scotland – is designed to give individualised support to 38,000 individuals furthest removed from the labour market.
* Supporting those affected by redundancy through the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE)

We have developed an employment support service - Fair Start Scotland - to help those facing the greatest barriers to work to find and stay in jobs, based on our over-arching principles of fairness and respect.  

We are also setting out how we will deliver more effective and joined up employability support across Scotland with the publication of No One Left Behind – Next Steps for the Integration and Alignment of Employability Support in Scotland.  

We developed links between employment support and other services through the £2.5 million Employability Innovation and Integration Fund (EIF). The Employability Innovation and Integration Fund was a two-year initiative, which ran between 2017/18 and 2018/19.  Through the fund we supported 13 projects across 15 local authority areas, with evaluation of the projects is due to be submitted in November 2019.  

We have launched Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) to officials by focusing funds on those actively seeking employment and those who are currently in low paid work and looking to progress.  Officials are currently working with stakeholders to review the programme in line with the recommendation from the E&S Strategic Board.  

We will continue to support those affected by redundancy through the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE), while providing careers and skills advice to people of all ages through the Skills Development Scotland agency.
