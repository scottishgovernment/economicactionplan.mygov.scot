Creating a culture of shared investment across the skills system will be a key facet of this.</p> 

<p>Across four themes the Plan highlights the vital role the skills system will play in helping Scotland to respond to future socio-economic challenges, such as demographic changes and the climate emergency. It establishes a thematic approach to working with stakeholders from across the skills system to identify and develop the specific solutions required to achieve our vision for Scotland’s skills system in the medium to long term.</p>
