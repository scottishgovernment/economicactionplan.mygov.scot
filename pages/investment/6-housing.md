## Key points:

- A vision for how our homes and communities should look and feel in 2040 and route map to get there.
- Over £3.3 billion to deliver at least 50,000 affordable homes, of which 35,000 will be for social rent, over this parliamentary term
- More than £500m in energy efficiency over the lifetime of this Parliament
- Recognising housing and home as the foundation for economic participation and wellbeing

We are spending over £3.3 billion to deliver 50,000 affordable homes, of which 35,000 will be for social rent, by March 2021.  This investment, in partnership with councils, housing associations and developers, will leverage economic output in the region of £1.4 billion per year, supporting around 10,000 to 12,000 jobs per annum in the construction and related industries in Scotland.

An increasing supply of rural housing is provided through the mainstream affordable housing programme delivered through Local Authorities and Registered Social Landlords.
Additionally we will continue to support the building of more houses in rural areas to meet local needs via the £30 million Rural and Island Housing Fund.  

Read about [rural housing in Lochalsh and Skye](http://www.hie.co.uk/community-support/community-conference/videos.html). Following a successful self-build loan fund pilot in the Highland Council area which supported the construction of 14 new homes, we launched a £4m national fund in September 2018. This offers loans of up to £175,000 to help with construction costs. Since January 2007 we have approved croft house grant payments of over £19 million to assist the building and improvement of over 960 croft houses which is helping to sustain rural communities and businesses.  

Over the lifetime of this Parliament we have invested over £500 million in tackling fuel poverty and improving the energy efficiency of our homes. Between now and 2040, we will continue to transform all of Scotland’s buildings to be warmer, greener and more energy efficient through the Energy Efficient Scotland Programme sets out how we will achieve this ambition.  

We will now enable businesses within the housing supply system to better plan ahead by developing our roadmap to show how our homes and communities should look and feel in 2040.  This encompasses the whole housing system and its contribution through creating communities that deliver better quality of life for people and communities, supporting repopulation in rural areas and boosting economic growth as well as tackling homelessness and ensuring housing meets the neds of older and disabled people.  We will make a one off investment of up to £2 million in existing public sites for gypsy travellers over and above the Minimum Standards to signal our commitment to change in this area, taking direct action to raise standards in the short term, as we continue work with partners on the longer term strategic actions.  The funding will be available for 2020-21.  

We also continue to put into practice the key aims of the [Place Principle](https://www.gov.scot/publications/place-principle-introduction/) to ensure a joined-up, collaborative, and participative approach to services, land and buildings, across all sectors within a place. This includes supporting the development of a pipeline of strategic sites from the regional city deal commitments.
