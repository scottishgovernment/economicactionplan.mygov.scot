## National Infrastructure Mission 

To maintain competitive economic conditions in an increasingly global market, and to deliver a long term boost to Scotland’s economy, we will drive forward a National Infrastructure Mission and steadily increase Scotland’s annual infrastructure investment until it is £1.5 billion higher by the end of the next Parliament than in 2019-20.  On current estimates that would mean around £7 billion of extra infrastructure investment by the end of the next Parliament. 

It is vital that the right investments are made that generate inclusive growth and deliver our carbon neutral objectives.  Investment in economic infrastructure is a key driver of growth. For example, investment in broadband, transport and utilities provides the foundation for companies to invest and brings new economic opportunities to remote and deprived parts of the country.  We will identify the priority infrastructure projects that can unlock the greatest productivity gains advised by a new Infrastructure Commission and through the development of the next Infrastructure Investment Plan. 

The Infrastructure Commission that will identify key strategic investments in Scotland to be made to boost economic growth and support public services will also be asked to report on creating a Scottish National Infrastructure Company.

## Construction Industry

Our ambitious infrastructure plans will rely on a construction industry that is both well positioned to deliver and understands the wider social and economic wellbeing priorities associated with that delivery. Working across government, we will take steps to form a refreshed and stronger relationship between government and the construction sector (including organisations such as Construction Scotland, the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, the Construction Scotland Innovation Centre and the trade unions) around a set of common goals to help the sector grow.

## Scottish Water

Water is one of our most important natural assets, and Scottish Water will continue to invest around £600 million each year in our water and wastewater infrastructure, supporting jobs across the economy whilst providing 1.38 billion litres of fresh, high quality drinking water every day, and treating our waste water before returning it safely to the environment.
