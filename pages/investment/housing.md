## Affordable Homes

We are spending over £3 billion to deliver at least 50,000 [affordable homes](https://beta.gov.scot/policies/more-homes/affordable-housing-supply/), of which 35,000 will be for social rent, by March 2021. This investment, in partnership with councils, housing associations and developers, will leverage economic output in the region of £1.4 billion per year, supporting around 10,000 to 12,000 jobs per annum in the construction and related industries in Scotland. 

## Energy Efficiency

To improve the quality of our homes, we are investing £500m in energy efficiency over the lifetime of this Parliament. We will continue to ensure availability of the [Housing Infrastructure Fund](https://beta.gov.scot/policies/more-homes/housing-infrastructure-fund/) (HIF) across the country to support housing to come forward on strategic sites in both urban and rural areas through support for enabling infrastructure.

## Rural Housing

We will continue to support the building of more houses in rural areas and following the pilot of a [Self-Build Loan Fund](https://www.mygov.scot/self-build-loan-fund/) in the Highland Council Area, we will implement this initiative nationwide offering loans of up to £175,000.  Since January 2007 we have approved croft house grant payments of over £18 million assisting the building and improvement of over 900 croft houses helping to sustain rural communities and businesses.

## Roadmap to 2040

We will now enable businesses within the housing supply system to better plan ahead by developing our roadmap to show how our homes and communities should look and feel in 2040. This encompasses the whole housing system and its contribution through creating communities that deliver better quality of life for people and communities, supporting repopulation in rural areas and boosting economic growth.
