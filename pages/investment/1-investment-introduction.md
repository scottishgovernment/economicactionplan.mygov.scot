We want to boost private and public investment to create the conditions for Scottish businesses and people to flourish. We will increase infrastructure investment to the most ambitious long-term level that Scotland has ever seen.  This will drive up connectivity, create jobs and deliver a long-term boost to productivity and sustainable and inclusive economic growth, while safeguarding the potential impacts on our environment.  

We also know that the successful economies of the 21st century will be carbon neutral. That is why we are investing in sectors and businesses that have the potential to lead this transition and create global opportunities for Scottish goods and services.

## *case study:*{:.hidden} Building Scotland’s biggest port

Established in 1136, Aberdeen Harbour is officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as one of Britain’s oldest existing businesses. Soon, it will be able to claim the title of Scotland’s biggest port.  

Long recognised as a vital cog in Scotland’s economy – it has supported the growth of the fishing and oil and gas industries among numerous others – the harbour is undergoing a major modernisation programme that will open the door to new markets.  

The Scottish Government is contributing £11.7 million to the overall project cost of £350 million. Once complete, the expansion of the harbour at Nigg Bay is expected to help Scotland tap into the opportunities presented by the renewables and cruise tourism industries.  

Commenting on the award in 2017, Aberdeen Harbour’s then Chief Executive, Colin Parker, said: "This funding is immensely significant. It further demonstrates recognition of this strategic project as one of national and international importance. The facilities developed will transform the port’s ability to accommodate the trend for larger vessels we are witnessing across a whole range of industries, thereby encouraging commercial diversification and future-proofing the port’s ability to support large-scale marine operations."
