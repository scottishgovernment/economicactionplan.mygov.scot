***Record levels of infrastructure investment***

## Key points:

- Our new National Infrastructure Mission will increase Scotland’s annual infrastructure investment
- We are stepping up our engagement with the construction sector

To maintain competitive economic conditions in an increasingly global market, and to deliver a long term boost to Scotland’s economy, we will drive forward a National Infrastructure Mission and steadily increase Scotland’s annual infrastructure investment until it is £1.5 billion higher by the end of the next Parliament than in 2019-20.  On current estimates that would mean around £7 billion of extra infrastructure investment by the end of the next Parliament.  

It is vital that the right investments are made that generate inclusive growth and deliver our carbon neutral objectives.  Investment in economic infrastructure is a key driver of growth. For example, investment in broadband, transport and utilities provides the foundation for companies to invest and brings new economic opportunities to remote and deprived parts of the country.  We will identify the priority infrastructure projects that can unlock the greatest productivity gains advised by a new Infrastructure Commission and through the development of the next Infrastructure Investment Plan.  

The [Infrastructure Commission](https://infrastructurecommission.scot/) that will identify key strategic investments in Scotland to be made to boost economic growth and support public services will also be asked to report on creating a Scottish National Infrastructure Company.  
The Infrastructure Commission, chaired by Ian Russell CBE, will provide independent, informed advice on the vision, ambition and priorities for Scotland’s infrastructure to boost economic growth and support public services. The Commission’s advice will help inform the new Infrastructure Investment Plan and Capital Spending Review that we will publish by mid-2020.  

Our ambitious infrastructure plans will rely on a construction industry that is both well positioned to deliver and understands the wider social and economic wellbeing priorities associated with that delivery. Working across government, we are taking steps to form a refreshed and stronger relationship between government and the construction sector (including organisations such as Construction Scotland, the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, the Construction Scotland Innovation Centre and the trade unions) around a set of common goals to help the sector grow.  

We are already seeing fruits from this new relationship. We are working with industry and public bodies to address the issue of unsustainable pricing, and discussing how to evolve an industry wide culture of continuous improvement. We are currently developing a sourcing strategy for the Construction portfolio that will encapsulate good practice in the delivery of public infrastructure and buildings.

The results from this graph indicate a close empirical correlation particularly between the level of SG-supported investment, and activity.  Overall construction patterns mirror what the public sector has enabled.  The impact of changes in Council borrowing levels can also be seen.  Overall, and even whilst not having full fiscal powers, it can be seen that choices made by Scottish Government within its current framework can have a powerful effect.  

The EU Horizon 2020 Expert Group recognises notes that nature-based solutions including green and blue infrastructure have demonstrated financial advantages due to a reduction in initial capital expenses and on-going operational expenses and they have been used strategically to recapitalise ageing resources. Nature-based solutions can also offer more opportunities than 'grey' infrastructure, as they not only increase the resilience of society to external economic and environmental stresses, but contribute positively to human health and well-being. It recognises these components are essential for sustainable competitiveness.  

Water is one of our most important natural assets, and Scottish Water will continue to invest around £600 million each year in our water and wastewater infrastructure, supporting jobs across the economy whilst providing 1.38 billion litres of fresh, high quality drinking water every day, and treating our waste water before returning it safely to the environment.  

Flood risk is increasing due to climate change.  We will continue to invest £42 million each year on flood protection infrastructure to reduce the impact of flooding on homes and businesses and minimise the damage to the economy.  

We are also stepping up engagement with the construction sector by working across procurement, infrastructure, economic development and built environment interests, as well as with our enterprise and skills agencies, to help the sector thrive and grow.  

Our Green Growth Accelerator will extend the current Growth Accelerator model to unlock additional investment for infrastructure projects which support our transition to a net zero emissions economy.  

The model follows the development of Growth Accelerators in Edinburgh City Centre and the Dundee Waterfront – which combine public and private investment to transform cities and regions.  

We will work closely with COSLA, Local Authorities and local economic delivery partners across Scotland as we develop our approach.
