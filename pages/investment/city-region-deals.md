* **City Region Deals act as enablers to unlock economic assets**
* **We are delivering City Region Deals for all our cities and have already committed investment of up to £1.125 billion over the next 10-20 years for City Region Deals across Scotland** 

<hr>

City deals worth up to £1.125 billion over the next 10 to 20 years have been agreed for the Glasgow City Region, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Highlands, Edinburgh and South East Scotland, and Stirling and Clackmannanshire.  A deal for the Tay Cities Region is imminent.

Each deal is tailored to the social and economic situation of its region, with projects such as the Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen, the distributed learning of STEM subjects across Highland, and a focus on capitalising on data driven innovation in Edinburgh.

Deals galvanise key partners to come together to drive regional economies in ways that go well beyond the investments that they deliver, leveraging local and regional intelligence about how best to secure inclusive economic growth.

They act as a catalyst to support and enable a set of strong regional economic partnerships across Scotland that have a clear and active role for the private sector to help create and deliver a clear economic plan for the region.

That is why we are committed to delivering 100% coverage of deals across Scotland, with discussions underway on Growth Deals for Ayrshires, Borderlands, Moray, Falkirk, Argyll & Bute and the Islands.

City Region and Growth Deals build on our strong foundations of finding new ways to unlock economic investment, including our Tax Increment Financing and Growth Accelerator approaches where we have already delivered  two Growth Accelerator schemes: with the City of Edinburgh Council for the St James Quarter, unlocking around £1 billion of new development in the city centre; and with Dundee City Council involving £60 million of Scottish Government investment to support the wider £1 billion Waterfront Development that includes the iconic V&A Museum.
