While looking to take advantage of future economic opportunities, we can’t ignore the challenges we are facing, particularly the negative impact the continuing Brexit uncertainty is putting on Scotland’s growth.  

We need to build resilience within our businesses and industries. To help them continue to operate despite these challenges, while at the same time supporting them to grow by looking at new and different ways of doing things within the shifting economic landscape. We already know of many businesses that are innovating not just to face into the current headwinds, but to build a stronger, brighter future.  

Our Future Skills Action Plan [link] looks at how both employers and our skills support system can give people adaptable skills to help them and our businesses respond to future opportunities and challenges.  As we do that, we will continue to make sure that international citizens of Scotland know that this country remains a welcoming home for them.  

We’re a small, open economy, so our resilience is also dependent on our ability to trade easily and attract overseas investment and talent. Since the outcome of the Brexit referendum we’ve increased our efforts to support our companies to trade in Europe and beyond to ensure that the world knows that Scotland remains open and welcoming.  

We will continue to listen closely to businesses’ concerns, about Brexit but also about other issues, and help mitigate against any economic downturn by providing as much information, advice and support, including access to finance.  

We are not just thinking about resilience, we are also planning for the recovery that will be required after the initial challenges presented by the UK’s exit from the EU are over, and we will continue to support the economy to return to a position where sustainable, inclusive growth is achievable and becomes the new normal. And we must continue to look further ahead, restructuring our economy to ensure it is fit to meet the opportunities and challenges that will come our way in the 21st century.  

The initiatives set out in our Economic Action Plan are organised by the fundamental drivers of inclusive and sustainable growth: **Investment, Enterprise, International, Innovation, Skills, Place, People and Sustainability**.  

To ensure we build resilience, enable recovery and growth, and restructure for the future, there will be a particular focus on:

- Transforming our support for business [link]
- Realising the climate enterprise opportunity [link]
- Unlocking entrepreneurship [link]
- Developing the right skills [link]
