Our approach to Scotland’s economy, underpinned by the notion of  wellbeing and sustainable and inclusive growth means that we need to consider how our actions and investments across a broad range of areas – from health, to exports, to investment in skills, and focus on ‘good’ job creation - can influence economic outcomes  in a way that improves not only our competitiveness, but also the quality of economic growth and the distribution of economic opportunities and benefits across Scotland’s people and places.

We are taking action in the following key areas to make sure we are getting the fundamentals are right:  

- Investment: boosting private and public investment and delivering world-class infrastructure for a net-zero economy
- Enterprise: streamlining business support and ensuring a competitive business environment
- International: growing exports and international investment and attracting global talent
- Innovation: supporting world-leading innovation and a dynamic digital economy
- Skills: providing a highly skilled workforce through education, training and re-skilling
- Place: supporting places to thrive throughout Scotland: in our regions, cities, towns and rural areas, including our islands
- People: moving toward a world-leading working life where fair work drives success, wellbeing and prosperity for individuals, employers and society.
- Sustainability: seizing the economic opportunities of the transition to a climate-neutral economy

We will take these actions forward in a way that reflects our unwavering commitment to delivering inclusive growth across all of Scotland.
