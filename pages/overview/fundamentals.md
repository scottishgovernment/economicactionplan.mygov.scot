The Scottish Government defines inclusive growth as: “Growth that combines increased prosperity with greater equity; that creates opportunities for all and distributes the dividends of increased prosperity fairly”. 

We are taking action in the following key areas to make sure the fundamentals are right: 

* **Investment:** boosting private and public investment and delivering world-class infrastructure.
* **Enterprise:** streamlining business support and ensuring a competitive business environment.
* **International:** growing exports and international investment and attracting global talent.
* **Innovation:** supporting world-leading innovation and a dynamic digital economy.
* **Skills:** providing a highly skilled workforce through education, training and re-skilling.
* **Place:** supporting thriving places throughout Scotland: in our regions, cities, towns and rural areas, including our islands.
* **People:** moving toward a world-leading working life where fair work drives success, wellbeing and prosperity for individuals, employers and society.
* **Sustainability:** seizing the economic opportunities of the transition to a carbon neutral economy.

We will take these actions forward in a way that reflects our unwavering commitment to delivering inclusive growth across all of Scotland.
