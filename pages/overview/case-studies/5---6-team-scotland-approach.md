***A team approach brings new investment***

MIPIM is the world’s biggest real estate exhibition, bringing together the most influential players from all international property sectors. The event offers unrivalled access to the greatest number of development projects and sources of capital worldwide.  

The aim of Scotland’s involvement in MIPIM is to showcase the competitive advantages our country boasts.  

While there have been previous regional delegations, 2019 saw a collaborative Team Scotland presence at the event for the first time. Scotland’s economic development agencies, biggest local authorities and other public sector bodies joined together with private sector sponsors and partners to sell all of Scotland.  

Next March we’ll be back at MIPIM 2020, with more than 26,800 participants from more than 100 countries, to attract interest in development and investment opportunities and to ensure the rest of the world knows that Scotland is open for business.  

Attendance at MIPIM and similar events has led directly to £2 billion of investment in Scotland over the past decade, with projects including the St James’ Centre in Edinburgh and Glasgow’s Central Quay redevelopment.  

Stuart Parker, Managing Director of Construction Scotland at Morgan Sindall, said:
"MIPIM 2020 will provide Team Scotland with an excellent opportunity to showcase its impressive investment portfolio. Scotland has rightly received global recognition as a growing economy, and the delegation’s presence will benefit not only in terms of profile, but as a stimulus for sustained development and urban regeneration."
