***Helping Scottish companies prepare for Brexit***

The Prepare for Brexit campaign was launched in November 2018 and is a coordinated, pan-Scotland offering to support businesses, regardless of size, sector or location. It’s delivered in partnership by Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland and Business Gateway.  

The campaign aims to stimulate many more companies to take action in response to Brexit, supporting business and wider economic resilience in the face of significant change.  

The website – [www.PrepareforBrexit.scot](https://www.prepareforbrexit.scot/) – offers information and advice, a self-assessment tool, Brexit checklist, details of local information events, webinars and other resources. The Scottish Government has also made £2 million available to help SMEs manage a wide range of Brexit impacts, with funding of up to £4000 per company through the Brexit Support Grant.  

The grant can be accessed by businesses employing up to 250 staff and can be used for activities including consultancy support, professional fees, external training, and international market research. To date, 165 Brexit Support Grants have been awarded for company projects totalling £600,000.  

Since the Prepare for Brexit campaign launched, there have been 136,827 website visitors, 7061 completed company self-assessments and 498 enquiries from businesses.
One company that has accessed help and support is The Start-Up Drinks Lab. Hannah Fisher of the company said: "Restricted and more expensive supply of raw material will have a negative impact. Looking for a positive, we hope our new canning line will attract some of the clients that currently use canning companies in Germany and Belgium due to restricted trade."
