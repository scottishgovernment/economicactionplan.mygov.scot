***Ready for take-off with Spire Global***

Scotland’s space sector is set for lift-off after the First Minister announced £14.7 million of support for Spire Global to grow its operations in Glasgow.  

Spire Global builds, tests and operates nanosatellites, which track aviation, maritime and weather patterns. The funding will enable the company to move into new 40,000sq ft premises at Glasgow’s Skypark facility, creating 261 new skilled jobs in the process.  

This investment will also see the company’s expanded Glasgow site house both the manufacturing and testing capability for the group’s entire satellite constellation.  

The funding for Spire Global, which has offices across the world, demonstrates the Scottish Government and its agencies’ commitment to make Scotland the leading space nation in Europe.  

There are now more than 130 space organisations in Scotland, including the headquarters of 84 UK space industry firms, with a combined income of £140 million. More small satellites are also built in Glasgow than any other place in Europe, and last year plans were announced for the UK’s first spaceport in the far north of Scotland. These and other advances mean Scotland’s space sector could be worth £4 billion by 2030.  

Peter Platzer, co-Founder and CEO of Spire Global, said: "Glasgow has been a fantastic location for us, with exceptional talent and people with a phenomenal ‘can-do’ attitude and true grit.  We are excited to substantially expand our presence here and look forward to the continuation of strong partnerships within Scotland, the UK Space Agency, and the wider UK space ecosystems."
