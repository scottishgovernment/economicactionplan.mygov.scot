***Urban Foresight puts the wheels in motion on e-bike project***

Urban Foresight is a smart city consultancy based in Dundee, which helps cities deliver environmentally-focussed services such as electric vehicle charging, is working on innovative projects such as the UK’s largest e-bike scheme.  

The company, which received Regional Selective Support, moved to larger office space in August 2019 to expand its team just a year after establishing a base in the city.  

One of its major projects is the Mobility Innovation Living Laboratory (The MILL), a £2 million programme delivered on behalf of Dundee City Council to make Dundee a test-bed for transport innovations.  

The company is working closely with RideOn, a Spanish company, to bring 400 e-bikes to Dundee - thought to be one of the biggest bike sharing schemes of its kind in the UK.  

Infrastructure for the project is starting to go into the ground and a soft launch will take place in 2020 once the planning process is complete.  

Projects being trialled by The MILL also include Scotland’s largest smart parking project – a fleet vehicle sharing platform for public sector organisations and a car club that allows easier access beyond designated bays.
Urban Foresight director Rachel Beeton said the company was forecast to grow the 11 employees years, having already grown from a team of one to eight in a year.  
She said: "We look forward to working on more projects that improve lives, protect the environment and boost local economies, not just in Dundee but across Scotland and globally too."
