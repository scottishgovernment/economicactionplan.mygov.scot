We will seek to mitigate, as far as possible, the impacts of Brexit, due to take place on 31 January 2020.  

We understand that Brexit presents real challenges for many of Scotland’s people, businesses, organisations and communities.  These may be particularly acute for the rural economy given challenges around demographics and population, the supply of labour and the dependence in some sectors on the Common Agricultural Policy.  

We believe Scotland’s future is best served by continued EU membership, in line with the wishes of the Scottish people as expressed in the referendum in 2016.  

We have worked tirelessly since the 2016 referendum to prevent Brexit, and specifically also a no deal.  We have published compromise proposals, including remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union.  

As we set out in ‘Scotland’s Place in Europe: People, Jobs and Investment’, membership of the Single Market and Customs Union delivers economic benefits to Scotland.  Brexit will significantly weaken our economy and result in slower economic growth and lower incomes than otherwise.  A Brexit which results in the UK being outside the European Single Market and Customs Union will have the most damaging consequences for Scotland.  

Leaving the Single Market and Customs Union on 31 January 2020 will also compromise the vast range of common economic, social, consumer, and environmental standards that we have become accustomed to as a member of the EU.  This is not acceptable to the Scottish Government nor, we believe, to the people of Scotland.  

Taking action to mitigate impacts, the Prepare for Brexit campaign, led by the enterprise and skills agencies, will help businesses (and their key partners such as universities and colleges) review their plans in light of Brexit to ensure they can continue to develop their workforce, grow their business, export, innovate and access finance and investment.  We have also established the Stay in Scotland campaign to provide information, advice and support to EU citizens and produced a toolkit for employers and individuals.
