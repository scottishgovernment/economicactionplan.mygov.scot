We are clear that we cannot deliver a sustainable, inclusive economy alone.  This can only be achieved by a dynamic Team Scotland approach. Collaboration across the Scottish Government, our public bodies, further and higher education institutions, research institutes and the wider public and private sectors as well is required.  

An example of this approach is the Michelin Scotland Innovation Parc, a joint venture between Michelin, Dundee City Council and Scottish Enterprise to deliver Scotland’s centre for driving innovation and investment in sustainable mobility and low carbon energy, giving a significant boost to Scotland’s journey to net zero.  

It will provide business and industry with support packages containing a mix of grants, loans and incentives as well as competitive rates, space and expertise for innovation and prototypes. To make sure that this support is at the cutting edge of technological and industrial expertise, it will be backed up by partnerships with colleges, universities and industry experts.  

The Parc will also include an Advanced Skills Academy to help to develop the workforce of the future, delivering bespoke packages covering data, digital, creativity and innovation, as well as core technical skills.  

A similar approach was also taken with MIPIM, the world’s largest real estate conference.  Scotland’s economic development agencies, biggest local authorities and other public sector bodies joined together with private sector sponsors and partners to promote both the excellent investment opportunities available, and the private sector’s ability to deliver them on the ground.
