We want all of Scotland’s communities, large or small or somewhere in between, to benefit from investment in jobs, skills and infrastructure and be able to make the most of the assets they have.  

To help deliver that, we are committed to stimulating capital investment from the public and private sectors in local and regional economies.  This will require a strong partnership approach, particularly if we are to ensure that we can target more investment in the places where it can make the most significant difference and reduce geographical economic inequalities.  

As part of the ongoing development of Regional Economic Partnerships, inspired by the City Region and Growth Deal experience, we will work with local authorities and their partners to develop and refine their regional economic strategies and action plans. A key element of this work will involve developing regional prospectuses which will clearly articulate the case for private investment in regions and local areas either in supporting existing opportunities or by creating new opportunities. We will then use the united platform of the Scotland Is Now campaign to promote those investment opportunities globally at events and through our international networks.  

Place-making and place-based approaches provide opportunities for infrastructure to deliver multiple benefits in an efficient and coordinated manner to support economic growth and regeneration.  The Scottish Government and COSLA have recently agreed and adopted the [Place Principle](https://www.gov.scot/publications/place-principle-introduction/) to help overcome organisational and sectoral boundaries, encourage better collaboration and community involvement, and improve the impact of combined energy, resources and investment in Scotland’s regions and local areas.  

We have already committed over £1.8 billion to deals for all of Scotland’s city regions, Ayrshire, Borderlands, Moray and Argyll and Bute, and secured the commitment of the UK Government to pursuing 100% coverage of all of Scotland with deals.  

And we will develop a long-term vision and plan for the revitalisation of the River Clyde.
