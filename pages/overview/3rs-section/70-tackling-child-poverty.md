Scotland has set in statute the ambition to eradicate child poverty through the Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017, including four ambitious income-based targets to be met by 2030 and interim targets for 2023.  In March 2018 we published ‘Every Child, Every Chance’, the first Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan due under the Act, backed by a £50m Tackling Child Poverty Fund.  It sets out the concrete actions we are taking to 2022 to deliver progress against our ambition to eradicate child poverty in Scotland.  We published our first annual progress report (for 2018-19) in June 2019, which shows we’ve been working hard to build the foundations for transformational change as part of our determination to tackle generations of deep-seated poverty.  

Reducing child poverty brings strong social policy benefits to children’s outcomes.  It also has positive family impacts, boosting health and wellbeing and helping parents into work or developing their skills so they can make successful careers for themselves.  There is also a strong economic gain to the Scottish economy.  The Scottish Government estimates that £1.4bn was invested to support low income households in 2018-19.  Of this it is estimated that £527m was specifically targeted at children in poverty.  This is in addition to the universal support provided to families.  Analysis from Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) found that, in 2013, the total cost of child poverty in the UK was £29 billion – a pro-rata estimate for Scotland is £2.39 billion.  Half of these costs relate to public spending to mitigate the impact of child poverty, and also the costs arising from lower productivity of these families in the economy throughout life.  Boosting family incomes can help stimulate the economy and prevent intergenerational child poverty - poor children growing up to be poor parents – thus bringing long-term benefits.
