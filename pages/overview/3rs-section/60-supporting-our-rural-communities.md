We know that our rural Scotland makes a vital contribution to our national economy.  

The Government wants to help ensure that those young people who want to stay in the areas where they grew up are able to do that and can become active participants in the local economy and community.  

We will develop an action plan to support repopulation of our rural and island communities and work with partners to test approaches using small scale pilots in rural Scotland. We will publish the first ever National Islands Plan by the end of the year. It will set out how we and other public sector partners will work to improve outcomes for island economies and communities and, once it is published, we will report on our progress each year.  

We will continue to provide support to rural enterprises through our economic development agencies, Business Gateway and partners and will also test a place-based approach to integrated business support for micro-enterprises operating in rural areas, recognising the different challenges they face such as gaining access to markets and connectivity issues.  

The approach will aim to deliver flexible support that is tailored to the needs of the business and its geographical location.
