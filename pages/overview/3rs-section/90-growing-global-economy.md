It has never been more important for us to invest in inward investment and the benefit it brings in jobs, capital and talent. We must continue to be an open economy in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.  

Following this year's export plan A Trading Nation, we will deliver a foreign direct investment programme that will continue to bring high quality jobs to Scotland, and build the environment that encourages global businesses to base themselves here.  

We will focus our efforts in areas where we have identified Scotland has a competitive advantage, including emerging technologies in data, low-carbon and advanced manufacturing.  

In March 2020 we will launch a national prospectus Doing Good Business In Scotland, built on strong regional plans, to attract the interest of the international investment community.  

In addition, we will continue to build our profile and reputation in key international markets using the Brand Scotland umbrella, a refreshed approach to our Global Scots network platform and a new Talent Scotland e-citizen platform. This will be an online destination that will help overseas talent find the right career in Scotland and more importantly feel like a citizen as soon as they step foot on our soil.
