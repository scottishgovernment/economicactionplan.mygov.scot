It has never been more important for us to attract and maintain inward investment and the benefit it brings in jobs, capital and talent. We must continue to be an open economy in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.  

Following this year's export plan A Trading Nation, we will deliver an inward investment plan that will maximise the wider economic benefits of inward investment to the local and national economy and encourage global businesses to base themselves here.  

We will focus our efforts in areas where we have identified Scotland has an existing competitive advantage, as well as ensuring that we are equipped to tackle the worldâ€™s critical challenges with technologies like digital, data and AI.  Work will continue to look at ways to use digital technology to continue to develop our digital strategy and associated enablement and support approaches for rural communities.  

In March 2020 we will launch a national prospectus, Doing Good Business In Scotland, built on strong regional plans, to attract the interest of the international investment community.  

In addition, we will continue to build our profile and reputation in key international markets using the Brand Scotland umbrella, a refreshed approach to our Global Scots network platform and a new Talent Scotland e-citizen platform.  This will be an online destination that will help overseas talent find the right career in Scotland and more importantly feel like a citizen as soon as they step foot on our soil.
