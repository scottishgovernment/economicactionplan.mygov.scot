We want everyone in Scotland to live in high quality, energy efficient homes that are affordable and that meets their needs. We remain committed to delivering our target of 50,000 affordable homes of all tenures in communities right across Scotland and we are working closely with our delivery partners to ensure these are the right homes in the right places.  

Our record housing investment of £3.3 billion over this Parliament is the single biggest investment in, and delivery of, affordable housing since devolution. This investment, will, on average, leverage economic output in the region of £1.4 billion per year, supporting around 10,000 to 12,000 jobs per year in the construction and related industries in Scotland.  

We will continue to attract private investment through innovative financing approaches to wider housing supply and infrastructure provision, and through partnerships with public, commercial and non-profit sectors that marry commercial aims with government policy objectives.  

In addition to ensuring that there are more affordable homes to meet Scotland’s needs, we have ambitious but deliverable plans to end homelessness, eradicate fuel poverty and improve the safety and quality of all our houses.  By 2021 we will have allocated over £1 billion to energy efficiency improvements to existing homes, making them warmer and cheaper to heat.  

We also want to ensure that we have a housing system that is dynamic and resilient enough to respond to future changes and can help address the number of challenges we are facing, including an ageing population and a global climate emergency. That is why we have committed to plan together with stakeholders for how our homes and communities should look and feel by 2040, and the options and choices to the get there. We will consult on a draft vision and principles, and how to make them a reality, later this year. The outputs from this round of consultation will help to inform our housing routemap to 2040, which we are aiming to publish in 2020.
