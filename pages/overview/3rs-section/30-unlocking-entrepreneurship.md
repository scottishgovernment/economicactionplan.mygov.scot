We will continue to unlock the undoubted talent and ideas we have in abundance in Scotland - and the economic value these bring.  

Working with private sector partners, we’ve brought together a number of existing initiatives to create the Unlocking Ambition programme, which will accelerate the growth of Scotland’s most promising companies and develop the skills of our most talented entrepreneurs.
