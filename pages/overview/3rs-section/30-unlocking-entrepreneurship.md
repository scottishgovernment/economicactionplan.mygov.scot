We will continue to unlock the undoubted talent and ideas we have in abundance in Scotland and the economic value these bring.  

Working with private sector partners, weâ€™ve brought together a number of existing initiatives to create the Unlocking Ambition programme, which will ensure investment is made in the right places.
