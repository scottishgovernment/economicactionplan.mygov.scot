Our future public infrastructure programme will lay the foundations upon which we can build low and zero carbon homes, communities and industries.  

The coming year will see the publication of the recommendations of the Infrastructure Commission for Scotland in advance of the next Infrastructure Investment Plan and Capital Spending Review, setting out our commitment to delivering infrastructure projects which support our transition to a net zero emissions economy while delivering inclusive economic growth and creating sustainable places.  

The next Infrastructure Investment Plan will set out our strategic approach to infrastructure planning over the next five year period.  It will align with a range of other key Scottish Government frameworks, such as the forthcoming National Planning Framework, the National Transport Strategy (and associated Strategic Transport Projects Review) and the Climate Change Plan.  

Transport is essential for supporting sustainable and inclusive economic growth. We will publish our National Transport Strategy later this year, which will set out a compelling vision for the kind of transport system we want for Scotland over the next 20 years, one that protects our climate and improves lives.  

Transport is currently Scotlandâ€™s largest greenhouse gas-emitting sector and therefore has a critical role in helping to deliver our ambitious target of net zero emissions by 2045.
