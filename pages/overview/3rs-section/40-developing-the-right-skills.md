We will deliver better skills alignment between where we know there is demand for skills and the funded provision of skills, in order to reduce gaps in critical areas and drive improvements in productivity and growth. We know that skill shortages have impacts on: business performance through increased workloads for other staff; meeting customer services objectives; operating costs; and the ability to quickly develop new products and services.  

As part of our expansion of apprenticeships we will focus on increasing the number of Graduate Apprenticeships and Foundation Apprenticeships. This will help improve productivity, reduce costs, increase tax revenue and reduce student debt. We want to see quicker routes to employment, with more learners on a faster path to in-demand jobs, which will in turn increase productivity.  

We will work with partners to implement the Skills Action Plan for Rural Scotland to support the skills needs of the rural economy by addressing skills shortages, talent retention and attraction, and demographic challenges.
