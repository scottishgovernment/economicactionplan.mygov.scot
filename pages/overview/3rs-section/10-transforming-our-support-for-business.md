We’re fundamentally changing the way the public sector supports businesses in Scotland.  To make sure we get the right support, advice and funding to businesses quickly and effectively, we are working with our enterprise agencies and Business Gateway to establish the Business Support Partnership, which assembles and aligns all the support services that every business anywhere in Scotland can use. As part of this we will launch the Single Entry Point (SEP) by the end of 2019 – an online one-stop-shop, which will get help to businesses that need it, when they need it.  Business operates on a 24 hour basis and the support and advice they need should do that as well – the SEP will help deliver that and much more besides.  

We know that being a global citizen and socially responsible employer is good for business, so the SEP will be further developed to include clear and simple guidance and tools on how businesses can become greener and cleaner.  We want to make it easy for businesses to maximise business opportunities and get the full benefit of the low carbon solutions made possible by Scotland’s natural assets.
