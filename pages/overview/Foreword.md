This updated Plan sits against a backdrop of continued uncertainty created by the UKâ€™s exit from the EU and the risk this poses to jobs, businesses, communities and our economy.  And it sets out how determined we are to do whatever it takes, regardless of what manner of Brexit takes place, to create a high-performing, carbon-neutral economy which benefits everyone in Scotland, regardless of where they live.  

Brexit is not the only challenge we face.  We also need to adjust to the ever-changing global circumstances, so our companies can continue to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise, both here and in international markets.  But we can do this because we know our inventive spirit, creativity and entrepreneurship continue to be world-leading, with demand for Scottish products and services increasing across the globe.  

We continue to support technological and financial innovation.  And we try to ensure that the economic growth they bring promotes the wellbeing of everyone in our society.  That idea is integral to our economic strategy, and it is at the heart of our national performance framework.
We need to make sure we are supporting growth for the here and now, while restructuring our economy so we can take full advantage of future opportunities, such as the global move to carbon-neutral technology and business practices.  

Successful and productive economies are often subject to outside forces beyond our control. We need to deal with these challenges, but not be distracted by them. We need to create quality jobs which can sustain a dynamic and modern economy.  

We will continue to make Scotland a key location for attracting quality jobs from overseas, while helping to stimulate growth in employment at home, based on the principles of fair work, good pay and the equitable distribution of the wealth this creates.

We will make more investment capital available to businesses through the new Scottish National Investment Bank, while at the same time investing in housing, infrastructure and business growth at unprecedented levels.  

We will have a sustainable, inclusive and productive economy supported by a collaborative Team Scotland approach. And we will build on the existing close work between ourselves and our public bodies by aligning our talent and capabilities even further around shared priorities.  

In meeting the most ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions of any country, we will enable enterprise, efficiency and internationalisation, .focusing our efforts where competitive and comparative advantage meet, and investing in the extraordinary talent we are so lucky to have in Scotland.
