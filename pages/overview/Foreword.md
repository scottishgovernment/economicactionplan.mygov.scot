This updated Plan sits against a backdrop of continued uncertainty created by the UK’s forthcoming exit from the EU and the risk this poses to jobs, businesses, communities and our economy.  It sets out the suite of actions that we will take across all areas of Scotland’s economy, to deliver a high-performing, climate-neutral, innovative and inclusive economy which benefits everyone in Scotland, regardless of where they live.  
 
Brexit is not the only challenge we face.  We also need to adjust to the ever-changing global circumstances, so our companies can continue to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise, both here and in international markets.  But we can do this because we know our research, innovation and creativity continue to be world-leading, with demand for Scottish products and services increasing across the globe.  

Inclusive economic growth sits at the core of our economic policy approach to grow sustainably and to promote the wellbeing of everyone in our society.  It is a commitment to deliver an approach to the economy that delivers growth in a way that enhances the quality of life for all of our citizens and which is compatible with achieving net-zero emissions by 2045.  Doing so, will enable Scotland to create a distinct growth model that is equitable and sustainable from the outset. That idea is integral to our economic strategy, and it is at the heart of our national performance framework.  

We also need to address the demographic challenges we face, which are likely to be exacerbated by EU Exit.  Attracting people with the skills that our employers need has never been more important.  Encouraging people to stay in and return to Scotland and to move within the country can help to address regional skills gaps.  

We continue to support research and innovation.  We need to make sure we are supporting growth for the here and now, while restructuring our economy so we can take full advantage of future opportunities, such as the global move to climate-neutral technology and business practices.  Our excellent universities, research institutes and colleges play a continued role in supporting our businesses to achieve this through the provision of new knowledge, skills and innovation that increase the productivity of businesses.

All open economies, no matter how successful, are affected by global factors beyond their direct control. Scotland must deal with such challenges, but not be distracted by them.  We need to create quality jobs which can sustain a dynamic and modern, inclusive economy. 

We will continue to make Scotland a key location for attracting quality jobs from overseas and build on our reputation for international collaboration, while helping to stimulate growth in employment at home, based on the principles of fair work, good pay and the equitable distribution of the wealth this creates.

We know that rural and island Scotland makes a vital contribution to our national economy.  We continue to support rural enterprises and will develop an action plan to address the population issues affecting rural areas.

We will make more investment capital available to businesses through the new Scottish National Investment Bank, while at the same time investing in housing, infrastructure and business growth at unprecedented levels. 
 
We will have a sustainable, inclusive and productive economy supported by a collaborative Team Scotland approach. And we will build on the existing close work between ourselves and our public bodies by aligning our talent and capabilities even further around shared priorities.
 
In meeting the most ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions of any country, we will enable enterprise, efficiency and internationalisation and support research and innovation, focusing our efforts where the opportunity is greatest, and investing in the extraordinary talent we have in Scotland.
