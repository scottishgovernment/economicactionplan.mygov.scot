We are ramping up our promotion of Scotland as an open and outward looking country.  We want to attract investment and promote Scotland as a place to live. We are taking actions that send a clear signal of openness and opportunity to the world: 
  
* **A new £20m export investment** over the next 3 years to enhance and intensify support to businesses wishing to export. 
* **Established a trade Board and network of trade envoys** to champion Scottish businesses and exports abroad. 
* **Launched the Brexit readiness toolkit** for businesses to help them plan through the uncertainty and minimise impacts.
* **Raising the profile of Scotland’s brand through ‘Scotland is Now’**, a collaboration across our agencies. 
* **Added to our presence in more than 30 countries** by adding new offices in Dublin, London and Berlin.
