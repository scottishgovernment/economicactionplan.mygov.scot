This site places small files, known as 'cookies', onto your computer to collect information about how you browse.

We do this to track things like the number of people who visit various parts of the site.

We also do it to help make sure the site is meeting your needs and to help us make improvements.

These cookies aren't used to identify you personally.

You will normally see a message on the site before we store a cookie on your computer.

## Measuring site usage

We use Google Analytics, Google Optimize and Mouseflow software to collect information about how you use mygov.scot.

We store information about:

* the pages you visit and how long you spend on each page
* how you got to mygov.scot
* what you click on while you're visiting mygov.scot
* which variation of a page you've visited when we are testing out small design changes using Google Optimize

Any information we get is received in a way that we can't identify anyone by it. For example, we never receive your name or address.

We don't make any attempt to find out the identities of people visiting mygov.scot, and we don't allow Google or Mouseflow to do this either.

All information we get through cookies and analytics will be treated in confidence. We will never sell, trade or give your details to third parties, unless we're required to do it by law.
