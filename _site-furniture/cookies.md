## Why we use cookies
We use economicactionplan.mygov.scot cookie tracking data to make informed decisions on whether the site is meeting your needs, which leads to us making improvements. For example, we monitor how much traffic each part of the site gets and work to improve areas which are not being found when they should be.

<div class="info-note note">
The cookies that we set on economicactionplan.mygov.scot cannot be used to identify you personally. <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/online/cookies/">Find out more about how to manage cookies for all websites</a>
</div>

## Cookies that we set
We use several tools &mdash; Google Analytics, Google Optimize and Mouseflow &mdash; to collect information about how you use mygov.scot.

We store information about:
* the pages you visit and how long you spend on each page
* how you got to mygov.scot
* what you click on while you're visiting mygov.scot
* which variation of a page you've visited when we are testing out small design changes using Google Optimize

We do not:
* collect information that can be used to identify you; for example, we never receive your name or address
* make any attempt to find out the identities of people visiting mygov.scot
* allow the tools that we use to do this either
* sell, trade or give your details to third parties, unless we are required to do it by law

All information we get through cookies and analytics will be treated in confidence.

### Google Analytics

We anonymise the last 3 digits of all economicactionplan.mygov.scot user IP addresses for Google Analytics, so that we can ensure that you are protected ([you can read more about how this works here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en)). We can only see a general overview of which regions and cities you may come from, not where individuals access from.

You can opt [out of Google analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) cookies.

        <tr>
            <td>_gid</td>
            <td>_gid has a different ID for each page set on, and a timestamp.  This assists with plotting user journeys.</td>

### Mouseflow

### Google Optimize
We use Google Optimize to run A/B testing on mygov.scot. An example would be to test the same page but with two slightly different formats &mdash; from this we are able to understand what types of page work better for you.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Information</th>
            <th>Expiry</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>_gaexp</td>
            <td>Used to determine a user's inclusion in an experiment and the expiry of experiments a user has been included in.</td>
            <td>Depends on the length of the experiment but typically 90 days</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### YouTube
Pages on mygov.scot which contain YouTube videos will not set third-party cookies (we use YouTube-nocookie.com &mdash; [you can read more here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en-GB)).
